West Winds is West High School's literary and art magazine since the 1914/15
school year. We give a voice to the young artists of our school and seek to
foster lifelong creativity. We also aim to introduce students to the world of
publishing and help them explore possible career paths. Each year we publish a full color magazine before the summer. This year's theme is "Community."

To showcase more student work, we publish a website each year alongside the
printed magazine. Like the magazine, this website is lovingly created entirely
by students on the West Winds staff.

To submit your work to West Winds, email your files to
[{{site.email}}](mailto://{{site.email}}).

Anyone interested in publishing or the arts is welcome to join West Winds. No
prior experience is needed, but we are looking for students with experience
with any of the following: Photoshop, Indesign, photography, graphic design,
film, recording music, coding, or editing written pieces.

Feel free to drop by our weekly meetings. Contact Mr. Packer or the current
Editor-in-Chief for more information about the club.
