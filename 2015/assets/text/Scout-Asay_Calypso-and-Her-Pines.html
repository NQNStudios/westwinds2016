I am Calypso, <br/> And nobody can stay <br/> On this island <br/> Made for one; <br/>   <br/> So the warning goes. <br/>   <br/> I have wondered <br/> What I did before <br/> To earn this prison, <br/> Struggled to <br/> Remember past lives, <br/> Where I must have done <br/> Terrible things <br/> To deserve this desert <br/> That floats in deseret <br/>   <br/> An island of <br/> Waiting, <br/> Finding, <br/> Falling, <br/> And being left behind. <br/>   <br/> Yes, <br/> They always say <br/> They love me, <br/> But none of them stay. <br/>   <br/> Just stay! <br/> I entreat, <br/> But they don’t; <br/> They can’t. <br/>   <br/> It is my inheritance. <br/> I cannot escape it. <br/>   <br/> You may try to <br/> Cheat fate, <br/> You may drive <br/> Destiny to its knees, <br/> But you will leave me, <br/> Willingly, <br/> After a time. <br/> There is no contest. <br/>   <br/> You certainly, <br/> Surely will depart, <br/> As each and every did before, <br/> And burn a notch <br/> Into my heart <br/> As you pass <br/> Under my pine trees, <br/> The only thing <br/> I am not allergic to, <br/> The only beings <br/> Who will leave with me, <br/> And not before, <br/> My only allies in this war.
