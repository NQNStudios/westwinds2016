<span class="T3">The windows of the house looked kind and warm at night, <br/>the way they leaked the yellow light of home <br/>out onto the rocks, grass, and trees. <br/>They seemed suspended in the night, like beacons of hope, reminders of love. <br/>To make one and all feel loved and at home. <br/>The yellow light spilled out onto the street, <br/>cheerful and welcoming, acting like a candle to all the lost and lonely souls<br/>—the moths of the human race.

It hurt to turn away but she did, eventually; <br/>she turned from that warm light, denying the remorse, the hate. <br/>It was behind her now, that light. <br/>She couldn’t go back, no matter the warmth, the welcome. <br/>The calamity in her soul forbid it and as <br/>she walked from the house, each small step a feat, <br/>her eyes filled with tears. <br/>The whispers of darkness pricked at her ears but she kept walking. <br/>The promise of depth, the whimper of lost hope, tickled her consciousness. <br/></span>Come<span class="T3">, it murmured into her being, <br/>its ghost-like, chilly tendrils dragging her <br/>further and further into the dark masses of loss. <br/></span>Come to us.

At first, she ignored the sweet talk, <br/>ignored the wonderful mutter, she held her <br/>livelihood close to her, safe. <br/>But the talk changed to song, <br/>with such wondrous dark beauty, fluctuating, <br/>wearing down on her mind, <br/>clogging her thoughts with senselessness, <br/>she was worked into forthcoming. <br/></span>Talk<span class="T3">, the melody demanded. <br/></span>Talk to us.

She spoke her words of vice, <br/>spoke the bitterness that she did not feel but knew to be true. <br/>She spoke, and her voice grew and <br/>she yelled and her voice died and <br/>she whimpered. <br/>She whimpered the misdealing of her youth, <br/>the misguiding of her adulthood. <br/>She yelled her disregard for amore, <br/>and told of her passion for innocence, injustice. <br/>She spoke of the vague mist of her life, and she did not cry. </span>

Finally, she kneeled, stopped walking, <br/>fell into the darkness with mirth and poise. <br/>Finally, she had begun her descent<br/>into what she knew was coming; <br/>she welcomed the dust much as she had the <br/>yellow light long before. <br/>Finally, she slept.</span> <span class="T3">Finally, she kneeled, stopped walking, <br/>fell into the darkness with mirth and poise. <br/>Finally, she had begun her descent<br/>into what she knew was coming; <br/>she welcomed the dust much as she had the <br/>yellow light long before. <br/>Finally, she slept.</span> Finally, she kneeled, stopped walking, <br/> fell into the darkness with mirth and poise. <br/> Finally, she had begun her descent <br/> into what she knew was coming; <br/> she welcomed the dust much as she had the <br/> yellow light long before. <br/> Finally, she slept.
