The world weeps today <br/> Tears that fall unwelcome <br/> From the heaven’s dour eye <br/> Upon a stony ground <br/> We have dispersed <br/> To cover the mirrors <br/> With black mourning cloth <br/> So that the dead may pass on <br/> We put away our sunlit hues <br/> To don black mourning garb <br/> And stare shocked <br/> At the audacity of flowers <br/> As the heavens dress in <br/> Baleful black and let go <br/> Of river tears <br/> The flowers don their brightest robes <br/> And the grass takes out <br/> Its greenest gown <br/> To dry the heaven’s tears
