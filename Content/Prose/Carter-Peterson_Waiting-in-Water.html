She had to read the boring book. Had to write a paper. Had to finish math <br />homework. Had to turn in missing work. Had to do this. Had to do that. ​There was always <br />something to do. Something that needed to be done. Something that became a <br />monster. <br />But not here. <br />The waves seemed endless. Always they washed up the bank, spreading tiny <br />rivers through the grains of dirt. The ever flowing water would reach the peak of its <br />momentum, and just for a moment... the wave ceased to be. For those few invisible <br />moments, the water clutched onto the shore, gripping with futile grasp, begging to stay <br />above its own body for just a couple more moments. The pleas.. never heard. The <br />desperate peak fell back into its own depression, moaning in frustration. <br />She gazed out at the lake. The center of the pool seemed completely still as she <br />looked above the water flowing back and forth over her bare feet. Always moving, but <br />never drifting. She gazed at the center, seeing no disturbance. Still, yet flowing. But <br />even as she looked, she could feel the water rising to her feet, tickling her toes, and <br />sinking into the dirt beneath her.  It was an enigma.   <br />The lake was isolated from the world. Ringed by tall trees of ashen leaves, it was <br />a sanctuary of the wild. The bank of the pool was nearly nonexistent, covered in wet, <br />dying underbrush. No sunlight brightened the lake, as the sky has morphed into a <br />flowing ocean of grey clouds. A fog closed in around the basin, isolating all but the first <br />ring of trees from the rest of the world. She was alone. <br />She felt the water tickle her feet again. The lake was silent.. with only one noise. <br />She did not know what it was, but she knew it came from the lake. She peered deeply <br />into the lake, searching for whatever was calling her. Nothing could be seen but the <br />perfectly still surface. No ripples sent minute waves across the expanse. No underwater <br />creature disturbed its tidal abode. There was nothing to be seen. <br />But it continued to call.  <br />  She took one step into the water. Cold, but not freezing. Another step. The sandy <br />dirt underneath erupted around her foot as it pressed into the soft clay. Another. The <br />brisk water rose up to her ankle now. Another. She could feel herself being lowered into <br />the ground. Another. The dirt floor felt like a cushion as it pressed up between her toes. <br />Another. She was to her waist now, feeling the crisp waterline against her skin. She <br />pressed down on her feet, and pushed off onto her belly, floating into the water. She <br />spun around so that her back was submerged, and her face looked up at the misty sky. <br />She heard the call no more. <br />She drifted for an eternity. She was completely hidden from the world in this lake <br />of solitude. She didn’t have to worry. She didn’t have to think. She didn’t have to feel. <br />Her mind became empty, and she closed her eyes, embracing the utter peace. Drifting <br />in endless tranquility. She was alone. She was calm. She was happy. <br />... <br />AIR! She needed air! Her eyes snapped open, stinging as water flowed into <br />them. Air. She saw a hint of light above her. Air. She pumped her arms against the <br />water, kicking her feet valiantly. Air. She felt her lungs empty, and felt her muscles strain <br />as they were denied life. Air! Her lungs demanded her to breathe in, to take in life. Air! <br />She fought them as much as she could. AIR! She could not open her mouth. AIR! The <br />light was closer. AIR! Closer. AIR! CLOSER! <br />Air. She breathed it into her body, giving herself life as she arched her back, <br />forcing her body to rise above the surface. The air flowed through her, into her lungs, <br />then into each muscle, each organ, each limb, until she was full of it. She kept it inside <br />of her for a moment, scared of letting it go. But her lungs forced it out of her, and she <br />took in another deep breath. In and out. In and out. In and out. Eventually, her breathing <br />became regular. <br />The lake was alive with sunlight. The water glistened like a field of flowing <br />crystals, and the ripples she had caused washed over them, making waves of <br />diamonds. The ashen trees were lit up by the sun, turned into a bright green shade. The <br />once overcast sky had broken apart to frame a beautiful orb of light as it shone down  <br />from the heavens. Her hair was sparkling with water crystals, and her skin was glowing <br />with the warm sunlight. She took in another breath, and smiled. <br />She was alive. <br /> <br /> <br /></html>
