She was </p><p class="Standard">overwhelmed. She had to read the boring book. Had to write a paper. Had to finish math </p><p class="Standard">homework. Had to turn in missing work. Had to do this. Had to do that. ​There was always </p><p class="Standard">something to do. Something that needed to be done. Something that became a </p><p class="Standard">monster. </p><p class="P1">But not here. </p><p class="P1">The waves seemed endless. Always they washed up the bank, spreading tiny </p><p class="Standard">rivers through the grains of dirt. The ever flowing water would reach the peak of its </p><p class="Standard">momentum, and just for a moment... the wave ceased to be. For those few invisible </p><p class="Standard">moments, the water clutched onto the shore, gripping with futile grasp, begging to stay </p><p class="Standard">above its own body for just a couple more moments. The pleas.. never heard. The </p><p class="Standard">desperate peak fell back into its own depression, moaning in frustration. </p><p class="P1">She gazed out at the lake. The center of the pool seemed completely still as she </p><p class="Standard">looked above the water flowing back and forth over her bare feet. Always moving, but </p><p class="Standard">never drifting. She gazed at the center, seeing no disturbance. Still, yet flowing. But </p><p class="Standard">even as she looked, she could feel the water rising to her feet, tickling her toes, and </p><p class="Standard">sinking into the dirt beneath her.  It was an enigma.   </p><p class="P1">The lake was isolated from the world. Ringed by tall trees of ashen leaves, it was </p><p class="Standard">a sanctuary of the wild. The bank of the pool was nearly nonexistent, covered in wet, </p><p class="Standard">dying underbrush. No sunlight brightened the lake, as the sky has morphed into a </p><p class="Standard">flowing ocean of grey clouds. A fog closed in around the basin, isolating all but the first </p><p class="Standard">ring of trees from the rest of the world. She was alone. </p><p class="P1">She felt the water tickle her feet again. The lake was silent.. with only one noise. </p><p class="Standard">She did not know what it was, but she knew it came from the lake. She peered deeply </p><p class="Standard">into the lake, searching for whatever was calling her. Nothing could be seen but the </p><p class="Standard">perfectly still surface. No ripples sent minute waves across the expanse. No underwater </p><p class="Standard">creature disturbed its tidal abode. There was nothing to be seen. </p><p class="P1">But it continued to call.  </p><p class="Standard"> <span> She took one step into the water. Cold, but not freezing. Another step. The sandy </span></p><p class="Standard">dirt underneath erupted around her foot as it pressed into the soft clay. Another. The </p><p class="Standard">brisk water rose up to her ankle now. Another. She could feel herself being lowered into </p><p class="Standard">the ground. Another. The dirt floor felt like a cushion as it pressed up between her toes. </p><p class="Standard">Another. She was to her waist now, feeling the crisp waterline against her skin. She </p><p class="Standard">pressed down on her feet, and pushed off onto her belly, floating into the water. She </p><p class="Standard">spun around so that her back was submerged, and her face looked up at the misty sky. </p><p class="P1">She heard the call no more. </p><p class="P1">She drifted for an eternity. She was completely hidden from the world in this lake </p><p class="Standard">of solitude. She didn’t have to worry. She didn’t have to think. She didn’t have to feel. </p><p class="Standard">Her mind became empty, and she closed her eyes, embracing the utter peace. Drifting </p><p class="Standard">in endless tranquility. She was alone. She was calm. She was happy. </p><p class="P1">... </p><p class="P1">AIR! She needed air! Her eyes snapped open, stinging as water flowed into </p><p class="Standard">them. Air. She saw a hint of light above her. Air. She pumped her arms against the </p><p class="Standard">water, kicking her feet valiantly. Air. She felt her lungs empty, and felt her muscles strain </p><p class="Standard">as they were denied life. Air! Her lungs demanded her to breathe in, to take in life. Air! </p><p class="Standard">She fought them as much as she could. AIR! She could not open her mouth. AIR! The </p><p class="Standard">light was closer. AIR! Closer. AIR! CLOSER! </p><p class="P1">Air. She breathed it into her body, giving herself life as she arched her back, </p><p class="Standard">forcing her body to rise above the surface. The air flowed through her, into her lungs, </p><p class="Standard">then into each muscle, each organ, each limb, until she was full of it. She kept it inside </p><p class="Standard">of her for a moment, scared of letting it go. But her lungs forced it out of her, and she </p><p class="Standard">took in another deep breath. In and out. In and out. In and out. Eventually, her breathing </p><p class="Standard">became regular. </p><p class="P1">The lake was alive with sunlight. The water glistened like a field of flowing </p><p class="Standard">crystals, and the ripples she had caused washed over them, making waves of </p><p class="Standard">diamonds. The ashen trees were lit up by the sun, turned into a bright green shade. The </p><p class="Standard">once overcast sky had broken apart to frame a beautiful orb of light as it shone down  </p><p class="Standard">from the heavens. Her hair was sparkling with water crystals, and her skin was glowing </p><p class="Standard">with the warm sunlight. She took in another breath, and smiled. </p><p class="P1">She was alive. </p><p class="Standard"> </p><p class="Standard"> </p></body></html>
