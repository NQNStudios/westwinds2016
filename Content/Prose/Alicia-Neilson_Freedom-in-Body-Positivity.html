My forearms and thighs carry reminders of one night stands with razor blades. Our promiscuous evenings together often begin and end with blank stares. There is an abundance of bare skin and deep kisses, but it is not making love, it is more like drunken, meaningless sex. Those affairs are meant to make me feel better, but when it's over I end up alone in my own bed, dressed in sweaters of shame.</span></p> <br /><p class="Standard"><span> My mind is strong and intelligent but it has difficulty producing serotonin and sometimes it goes haywire reminiscing about all the things he's said to me, and once in a while I get a headache trying to discover any hidden messages behind the words that slip out between perfect teeth.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The blood that travels through my veins doesn't circulate well to my hands and feet, but has no trouble rushing to my cheeks when he compliments me, and it seems even more willing to accompany my face after he says, “You're blushing.”</span></p> <br /><p class="Standard"><span> My legs are one of my favorite artifacts in my ever-changing museum of a body. They are long and lean. They wobble when I'm emotionally honest and my thighs don't touch but I cross my cold fingers that nobody takes that gap to mean weakness, because the small muscle surrounding my skeleton could carry me across oceans. These legs don't like to sit still for very long so in order to cope with their unceasing wanting to wander, they constantly bounce, cross, and uncross until they can take me somewhere new.</span></p> <br /><p class="Standard"><span> I adore the way my hands were carved as if out of ivory and I don't mind how they are cold like marble.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Maybe it's from scarcity of nutrition or the amplitude of sertraline, but my fists shake like the last leaf in autumn,</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> But it isn't falling that these fingers are afraid of</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Their trepidation comes from the possibility of never running through the dark forest of his hair.</span></p> <br /><p class="Standard"><span> This is my body.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> My blood is low on iron and my brain is lacking happy chemicals</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I have scars and sweat glands, guilty pleasures and vices</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> But I have alluring eyes and captivating words behind my gapped teeth</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I have an interesting history, unequal parts tragedy and comedy, and a single stretch mark on my left knee that I love.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> This is body positivity. This is me claiming my most prized possession after a decade of trying to trade it in for a stereotypical mold of a model.</span></p> <br /><p class="Standard"><span> This is freedom. </span></p></html>
