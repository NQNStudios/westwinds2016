“Peter O’Toole” <br/>   <br/> You changed my lens, made me think, <br/> I kept tabs on you through traces; <br/> The face-to-face, the sheer lack of ink, <br/> Do you know how my heart races? <br/>   <br/> Your wit, your might, bright eyes, and figure, <br/> Your sarcasm, earnestness, condescension; <br/> Yes, you stand alone, then stand with her, <br/> You later stand with him and them <br/>   <br/> Try I to keep away? You’ve never seen such efforts, <br/> But I am weakened, I am swayed, <br/> Closer, closer, in the manner of open hearts; <br/> At this rate, next week I’ll be slain <br/>   <br/> Thankfully, circumstances keep our distance long, <br/> My passions bottled, and never overflowing; <br/> I simply, sweetly hum song after song, <br/> The containment paradoxically stimulating <br/>   <br/> I sometimes ponder, though, what I’d say, <br/> If somehow, someday we collided, you and I, <br/> Could I make the small talk to pass the time of day, <br/> Or would I choke and stutter, manage a smile wry? <br/>   <br/> The minutes pass, counting grains of rice, <br/> But I imagine I ask if you come here often <br/> The exchange is enchanting, the chatter quite nice; <br/> Too bad you’re crammed in your coffin <br/>   <br/>
