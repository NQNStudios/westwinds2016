time, but I’ll let myself do things the easy way </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Just this once </span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Hello, my old friend </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">How long has it been since I gave you to the ground? </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">A year? </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Not even that, I think </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">My God, so much has happened </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">More than you or I could ever have comprehended </span></p><p

</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">But in so short a time, you have been swallowed by earth </span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">I dig my spade into the dirt, </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">The detritus of so many seasons gone and past </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Fallen, decaying leaves</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Rich and damp brown particles </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Red berries flashing like bright jewels in the depths </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Small rocks lodged within </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Worms building transient tunnels, a lace of spider-webs suspended above</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">The edges of the tree stump rising in a

class="P1"><span class="T1">When you and I know it meant so much more </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">I gave to you these things, objects of bittersweet memory, that they may be pure, </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Welcomed into your home, </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">More of my heart, given over to this little patch of land </span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">I did what I could</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">I arranged a ring of stones over your grave, marked the spot with a brilliant gold tulip, </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">A shining figment of sunlit warmth, vivid green grass, wind lapping over skin </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">So that all who passed would see my love for you, </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Written the only way I could think </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">I spoke to you, as I always do, </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Telling you of my life, </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Making you the promises I will build into every part of myself, </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Every action, bond, and dream </span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">I admired your glory, </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Weathered, commonplace, simplicity itself </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Yet, remarkable </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">And all those who walk by will not know—how could they?—how much you really are </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Poetry, in presence </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Making the ordinary extraordinary </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Memories and words, woven here in this sacred ground </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Marking who we once where, what can and will be </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">The days that have been, and the days that will come </span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">I will come back</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Maybe not for days, maybe not for weeks </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">But I will think of you, golden light and rushing streams, stones that have felt my blood, and radiant flowers </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">A shrine to each blow that reveals </span><span
