<p class="P1">Zoe Putnam<a name="_GoBack"></a></p> Zoe Putnam <a name="_GoBack"></a> The Wish Keeper’s Attic <br/> My father told me a tale <br/> When I was very small <br/> Of the wish keeper’s attic <br/> To the left of the hall <br/> There with dusty clumps of hope <br/> And spider webs of envious thought <br/> Lives an old wizened man <br/> Granting wishes for naught <br/> Beauty or love he’ll give by the gallon <br/> He has shelves full of joy to spare <br/> Give him a visit if you think it wise <br/> In the attic beneath the old stair <br/> He’ll grant you a boon <br/> With a smile, and wink <br/> He has a fountain of youth <br/> And he’ll willingly give you a drink <br/> He keeps a box full of wishes <br/> Tucked just out of sight <br/> And if you look close enough in the corner, <br/> You can see a dream’s mellow light <br/> That wizened granter of wishes <br/> And withered keeper of gold <br/> All of his goods are easily bought <br/> His starting price, a single secret told <br/>   <br/>
