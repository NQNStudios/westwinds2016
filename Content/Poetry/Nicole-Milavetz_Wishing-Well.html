Nicole Milavetz <br/> Wishing Well <br/> Â  <br/> My hands are like wishing wells. <br/> People come up to me from all over <br/> and put their hopes and dreams into my open palms <br/> They walk up to me and stand tall like a string is attached to the crown of their heads <br/> they open their mouths <br/> their lips slightly parted <br/> their silent <br/> hopes <br/> dreams <br/> fears <br/> stories <br/> love songs <br/> pleas <br/> wishes <br/> come out of their mouth and wash all over my body <br/> no words come out of their mouths yet I can feel their emotions rocking my body like I am a small ship bobbing on top of the ocean, water bubbling with excitement <br/> knowing that soon, a huge storm is coming <br/> not now <br/> maybe not even today or tomorrow <br/> but so soon. <br/> They reach out to me <br/> a wish has already transformed into a small copper coin <br/> that's what a wishing well is, you know. <br/> A place where coins go to drown, and dreams go to fly <br/> They close their eyes and clench their jaws like they are about to get the flu shot <br/> and BOOM <br/> the wish falls into my grasp and they look me in the eye for a split second as if to say thank you <br/> thank you. <br/> Then they turn around and walk away a little bit lighter <br/> but still so heavy <br/> because we are human <br/> and we are all so broken <br/> The cracks of their flaws show when they drop their coins into my open palms <br/> because I am a wishing well. <br/> My hands are wishing wells, and that is all I am <br/> that's all I am <br/> Don't look at me like I have <br/> fears and passions and dreams and nightmares, and love, and hate, and emotions, and feeling. <br/> And feeling <br/> feelings feelings. <br/> Because I don't <br/> I am a freaking wishing well. <br/> I am the place where coins go to drown, and dreams go to fly. <br/> Now that I am a wishing well I don't have to hurt anymore <br/> I don't have to cry <br/> I don't have to get attached to anyone because everyone I love always ends up leaving me <br/> somehow <br/> but not anymore, because all I am is a brick cylinder going <br/> down down down down <br/> into the ground <br/> instead of having to confront my emotions <br/> all I have to do is let go <br/> People bury themselves in me <br/> and this time <br/> this time, I don't have to say anything <br/> and it has never felt better. <br/>
