What school? Your name? Getting off here? Live nearby? <br />You stand too close, you smile with cold eyes, you won’t step away from me<br />And I run all the way home<br />Checking over my shoulder <br />Afraid that you haven’t left me alone <br />And sure enough, I see you again, <br />Hovering at my train station, <br />Day after day <br />So I keep running <br />I was thirteen <br /> <br />It’s summer <br />I’ll be across oceans in less than a week, and this is one of my last days with two girls who have come to mean so much to me <br />And we are walking up a hill <br />Four lanes of traffic beside us <br />You two come along, shouting at us from your truck <br />“Hey, girl!” <br />Isn’t that a brilliant thing to say? <br />It’s so terribly thoughtful of you, you know <br />How else would those fifteen-year-old girls be able to live with themselves? <br />Fortunately, they have you to yell at them <br />Aren’t you a national treasure! <br />We really did need you to interrupt one of our last chances to say goodbye  <br />I really can’t thank you enough <br />I was thirteen <br /> <br /></html>
