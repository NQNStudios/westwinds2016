What Freedom Means

Josie Messersmith

When I walk down the street, 

I feel my hair brush my back 

and the birds sing in my ear, careless

My nails are cut uneven, 

but that’s okay 

just like the flower you stepped on, 

they’ll grow back in time

the light will bring everything 

back to life.
