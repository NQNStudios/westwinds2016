A gentle inhale 

that releases mist

<br />

The smell of sweetly 

rotting leaves

is what keeps me walking

down the path turned journey

<br />

I’ll make the route 

Once I get there. 

Then others may follow

<br />

A hope unspoken, 

that I’ll be of use 

to you, 

<br />

unknown stranger

who has taken a path 

made of crushed aspirations, 

I did all this for you

<br />

In my next breath

I almost taste the trampled

leaves under foot. 

<br />

The sweet taste makes me smile
