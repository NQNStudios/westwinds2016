<p>. Petals So Soft .</p>

<p>You Avoid touch because the Oil on your Fingertips could Damage.</p>

<p>. Petals So Soft . </p>

<p>You Avoid conscious thoughts because You Want To Be Selfish.</p>

<p>. Petals So Soft . </p>

<p>You know Time takes things, So you know You must Enjoy This.</p>

<p>. Petals So Soft .</p>

<p>You Inhale All That she is </p>

<p>. So Luscious .</p>

<p>In All the While, her Petals Radiate </p>

<p>. So Precious .</p>

<p>She knows how her petals Curl</p>

<p>Knows what Makes her Pollen Grow</p>

<p>Knows the way her Stem Bestows</p>

<p>With that comes the knowledge of which she will Never Owe</p>

<p>Not to Anyone</p>

<p>Neither Friend or Foe</p>

<p>The Sepal she owns holds the Memory </p>

<p>of all that she has ever known. </p>

<p>But does she know the Gift that she Gives when that wind blows?</p>

<p>Doesn’t she know how Beautifully she’ll Grow?</p>

<p>When her Pedals fully Uncurl</p>

<p>. Feeding Colors to The World . </p>

<p>Making the Hallow</p>

<p>. Unhallowed .</p>

<p>Ultimately . . . She Knows </p>

<p>From the Countless attempts from Being Picked.        </p>

<p>From the Gloomy Weather and the </p>

<p>. Sorrow .</p>

<p>By being herself By</p>

<p>. Radiating .</p>

<p>Ultimately . . . She Knows </p>

<p>. The Sun Will Follow .</p>
