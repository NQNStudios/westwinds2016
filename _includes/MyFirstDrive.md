Drive: noun the determination and ambition of a person to achieve something

The first rush of purpose only came to Mayla after her father had died.

It had been an average evening. Mayla's job as a prosecution lawyer was continuing to show success, and she was rising quickly in her field. She had married her high school sweetie and was settling well into the new house. Everything was like clockwork. Nevertheless, it was getting a bit monotonous for her tastes. She had a nice life, but without any particular motive attached to it.

Mayla arrived home weary, untying the band that had squeezed her dark brown hair for the past ten hours. Throwing her suitcase to the floor with a satisfying thunk! she collapsed onto the sofa, smearing the makeup on her face as she rubbed it. A large yawn formed in her mouth as she reclined. Perhaps a bit too loud, she thought, Got to keep up my reputation in this house.

Her husband revealed his face from behind the kitchen. "Sounds like you're home. I could hear that for miles," he said, his mouth curved into a smile on one end.

"Hey, it didn't sound half as bad as your snores, Adam," she teased, but the two of them laughed and sat up on the couch.

"How was work?" he asked, combing the knots in her hair with his fingers.

"The usual. It's always the usual," she sighed. Mayla was about to go on a long talk about the subject, but the phone rang from the kitchen. "I'll get it," she said, rising and walking out of the living room.

Then the phone call came, and normal disappeared from their lives.

It was a simple theft. A man came in at midnight, left with some goods. Broke a few windows, scrambled the furniture.

But he also killed her father.

His name was Donald Murphy. And she was the prosecution attorney.

She became a merciless and cold machine. Everything, anything, to do her father justice. To get Murphy behind bars. Work wasn't so dull anymore. Mayla was driven with fervor, with determination, fed by an impassioned drive to wake up, to eat, to live only for that case.

One year. A year of paperwork, of questions, of controlling her urge to attack Murphy whenever he took the witness stand and blatantly lied. One year. And Murphy almost seemed to be off scot-free.

Mayla arrived home weary, skipping the couch and heading straight to her personal office. Her hair was already in tangled bunches, and her makeup has already been washed off after rubbing her eyes created black strips of mascara over her face. She noticed that Adam had worryingly shot a glance at her, but she sat down at the desk and began to write. Yet all she could picture was the court hearing today: how nothing was accomplished, how Murphy left the stand with a gleaming smile... Mayla slammed her fist onto the desk. She wrote even more furiously, her pen making wide swoops on the pad.

"Almost there... something, there's got to be something that will work..." she mumbled.

"Come on, Mayla, it's four. Get some rest..." Adam pleaded, having suddenly appeared behind her chair.

She glared at him. "Can you tell I am working here?" she snarled.

Adam took the pad of paper she had been writing on. Holding it up to her face, Mayla realized it was merely full of scribbles and ink blots. "This?" he asked.

Mayla blinked. "I-I...." she began, but she fell into his arms. She could feel the linen of his shirt getting wet. "I have to do this, Adam. J-just... for Dad..."

"I know, I know," he coaxed, stroking her hair just like that day when normal actually existed. "But your drive has gone way too far. You're still here, aren't you? Get some sleep. You still need yourself."

Mayla felt herself relenting to sleep as her vision became blurry. "B-but..." she whispered, before the clutches of slumber took her.

Donald Murphy was eventually found guilt of second degree murder and theft of Arthur Rill and given a life sentence. Mayla's long trial was finally over. And her drive was finally gone.

Mayla came home from work, tired yet happy, and fell onto the couch in the same position as she always did. Except this time, Adam was there.

"So it's finally over, huh?" he asked. Mayla nodded.

"I feel so empty inside though. Not that I would like to live that nightmare over again, but my body feels like I need that determination back, and it's just..." Mayla was forced to stop speaking as the two kissed. The first kiss they had truly experienced in a year.

"Mayla," he began as their lips separated. "I've told you this before. That drive you had, that rush to get Murphy in jail went too far at times. And I know that it was for your father and I know parts of it were necessary. But parts of it weren't. You're still here, Mayla."

"I know," she replied. "And I'm kind of glad it's over. I can finally get a good night's sleep." Mayla suddenly laughed out loud. Adam's eyebrows rose in surprise. "Well, not really," she added.

"After all, there's still your snoring."
