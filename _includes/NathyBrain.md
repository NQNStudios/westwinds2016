Romantic Nathy Brain, what’s going on in there? You’ve been locked in the control room for quite a while.

Romantic Nathy Brain, did you just give that girl her own message ringtone? That can’t be good for any of us. I’m afraid I’ll have to step in and reverse it.

No, Romantic Nathy Brain. It’s completely insane to think she was so impressed by your description of your D&amp;D character that she frantically set out to dump her boyfriend before she sees us next, and that’s why she’s not texting back.

Romantic Nathy Brain, you ruined dinner! You are *never* allowed to have control while we cook. Why don’t you step off for a bit?

Oh, what *now?* I know we’re only operating on a few hours’ sleep, but I trusted you, Trying-to- Focus-on- Other-Things Nathy Brain, and look what you’ve done! You let the puppy try to eat mom’s knitting while she cleaned up *our* mess. And all because you needed a perfect score in Geometry Wars. Now she’s mad at us, and what do we have to show for it? This is a disaster.

Romantic Nathy Brain, I’m going to have to kill you.
