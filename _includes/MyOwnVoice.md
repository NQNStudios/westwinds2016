Perhaps the most intimate connection I have ever felt is my voice coming from her lips. 

No, it is not the salt I taste on her, or feeling her body move with mine. It’s not our lips connected, joining us together, or the feeling of falling asleep together at 3 am. It’s not being too exhausted to talk anymore but too in love to separate. It’s not the lightning of her touch, or the sugary flavor of her lipgloss on my tongue. It’s not her hands in my hair, my lips on her skin. 

No the most intimate connection I have ever felt, was when I first heard myself in her. We started as two people, but I think maybe we aren’t anymore. She has my voice, my thoughts, and I hers. I have a laugh I didn’t used to, she has a lilt on her vowels now. She says words that were once foreign like “lovely” and “haunting” and I swear I used to swear more. Intimacy is my voice, my soul, resting on her tongue, breathing past her lips and entering the world as a thought on its own. Our own. I am the same. 

My voice is hers, my words are hers. My thoughts, my feelings, they are all hers, and hers are mine. 

Our voices are one.
