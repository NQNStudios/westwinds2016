I'm always the first to know<br/>That it's raining.<br/>Because the drops<br/>Hammer against the metal awning<br/>Outside my window,<br/>And it sounds like the world<br/>Is drumming its fingers on my house,<br/>In contemplation.<br />
What is it thinking about?<br/>Sometimes it wakes me,<br/>And I listen in the darkness,<br/>Waiting for a reason.<br/>Do you have something to tell me?<br/>Have you finally figured it out;<br />The everlasting problem?<br />

But it never tells me anything,<br/>And why would it?<br/>I'm puny, one white speck in a starfield.<br/>If I were the world, I wouldn't talk to me either.<br/>

But I'm lent some comfort,<br/>When that same contemplative drumming<br/>Becomes my soft and gentle lullaby.
