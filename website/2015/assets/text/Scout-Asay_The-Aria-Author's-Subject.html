I am not certain I feel similarly; <br/> I do not know how you feel <br/> You say come away, let us meet, <br/> But you are all too charming and spontaneous – <br/> Can you let a lady think? <br/>   <br/> It was too hot out in the streets, <br/> Yet hotter down below; <br/> The heat addled my brain and its thoughts, <br/> The humidity drugged, <br/> So truly, I cannot answer you <br/> A certain yes, a concrete no, <br/> A thousand words in sonnet form, <br/> Ten thousand more to come, <br/> For I simply, sweetly do not know, <br/> And your relentless admiration perpetuates <br/> The heat of the afternoon into the night <br/>   <br/> Please, my eager friend, step back, stand away, <br/> Let me breathe, let me seek – <br/> I am tired, I am worn, and your imploring ode <br/> I cannot sympathize with, as it stretches ‘round <br/> My head like a crown of roses’ thorns. <br/>   <br/> That makes me recall something out of lore: <br/> They say every rose has its thorns-- <br/> Those wise, and those foolish enough to repeat the wise; <br/> But you make me want to be a bundle of thorns! <br/> A burr, a thistle, anything with spines shall do-- <br/> And this is what your overtures induce, <br/> Dear poet, <br/> Dearest love, <br/>   <br/> You turn the object of your affection into a viper! <br/> Pussy claws the children after too much handling, <br/> The involuntary partaker of too much play. <br/> I am rather feline – had you ever noticed? – <br/> And your teasing, testosterone-charged charm <br/> Is transforming my pale pink nails to claws, <br/> My white teeth to fangs, and <br/> My vow of virtue to an assassin’s creed <br/>   <br/> I just thought you should know, <br/> My very dearest, <br/> In this interim between verses.
