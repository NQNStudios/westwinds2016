Apollo's servant claims he sees better through the bottom of his glass, <br/> That existence is more genial when observed through tinted lenses, <br/> That humanity itself is abstract, <br/> And therefore no God can lay a finger on him for his transgression of doubt <br/> When even the gods are but poor sinners not unlike himself. <br/> He claims he renounces conviction <br/> In divinity, in virtue, in love, in even himself, <br/> In anything except the bottles in his hand and the coin in his purse <br/> And the knowledge that absinthe-coaxed lethargy will one day peddle <br/> The very last hours of his existence to sleep. <br/> This he declares to be the only purpose of his life: to die <br/> And thus he denounces himself, <br/> Scorns the importance of his hands and their use <br/> Even as others scorn his ungainly feet and unkempt mind. <br/> Â  <br/> But in the face of Apollo's ravaged altar <br/> He claims he believes in the prophecies of Delphi <br/> Arise from slumber with eyes rimmed red <br/> Teeth and tongue in discord <br/> As he perjures himself to a court of worldly justice <br/> To the gatekeepers of the valley of the shadow of death <br/> Beseeches steel and flint that he may perish at Apollo's feet <br/> As more worthy men than him have done. <br/> For the self-proclaimed cynic is intoxicated by his own irony: <br/> His mind may demand ambiguity when it came to prophecies <br/> But his heart still loves Apollo, <br/> Marble, unmoved Apollo <br/> Whose belief and disposition is so different from his own <br/> That he cannot help but admire. <br/> His ardor his only conviction <br/> And that conviction stronger than the foundations of the stars <br/> That though he deemed little to be the absolute truth <br/> The cynic was the truest believer.
