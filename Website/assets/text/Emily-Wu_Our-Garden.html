Our garden hasn’t been much of a garden, <br/> Every since you left. <br/> You were always the green thumb out of the two of us <br/> And I’m sure you knew somewhere in the back of your mind <br/> When you packed up your suitcase and left it all behind <br/> That to leave this garden to me is basically <br/> The equivalent of condemning it to death. <br/> And I guess you didn’t really care. <br/> After all, you’re the green thumb. <br/> New flowers will grow where you will go. <br/>   <br/> I regret to say that in the months following your departure <br/> I had even less mind to garden. <br/> It sounded pathetic to my friends and even to myself <br/> But every blade of grass, every bud of multi-colored tulip <br/> <p class="Standard">Made me think of you<a name="_GoBack"></a></p> Made me think of you <a name="_GoBack"></a> And it burned me as much as the hot July sun <br/> Made the flowers wither. <br/> So I retreated back to our room (now completely mine) <br/> And I shut myself up like the coward I am. <br/>   <br/> I didn’t have the heart <br/> To let the roses we planted together die, though. <br/> Every time I thought to leave them to decay, <br/> I’d look up from my poems <br/> (I write them a lot now. <br/> I figure it’s better for my health than tubs of ice-cream) <br/> And out the window and I’ll hear your voice <br/> The day we buried the seeds into the ground, <br/> Remember the way your fingers brushed against mine <br/> And suddenly I’ll feel the urge to water those roses <br/> With my tears. <br/>   <br/> If you were here you’d have lamented at the mess I made <br/> Of the flowerbeds <br/> The year I tried to replant the petunias <br/> When they didn’t reappear in the summer. <br/> You’d have laughed at the effort I made, <br/> Hours and hours of research that somehow <br/> Ended with me on my knees in a mess of tears and dirt <br/> Bruised and bloody and tired. <br/>   <br/> I questioned myself that day <br/> For the first time in years. <br/> Wondered why I was replanting the petunias. <br/> I have a natural aversion to flowers, as I’m sure you remember, <br/> Called a pollen allergy <br/> And here I was on my hands and knees, <br/> Attempting to preserve the pollen-producing devils. <br/>   <br/> I came to a realization that day: <br/> I was doing it for you. <br/> Even though you were thousands of miles away <br/> Probably tending to your own garden <br/> With your new love and your new life <br/> Not even sparing a thought for me, <br/> I was thinking of you, <br/> I had spent the last three years thinking about you. <br/> I’d kept the roses alive, didn’t I? <br/>   <br/> <p class="Standard"><span class="T1">I also came to the realization that this is my garden now.<br/>That you left me three years ago.</span></p> <span class="T1">I also came to the realization that this is my garden now.<br/>That you left me three years ago.</span> I also came to the realization that this is my garden now. <br/> That you left me three years ago. And you left this garden with me. <br/> It struck me that I could do whatever I wished with it. <br/> So I did. <br/>   <br/> The petunias didn’t come back. <br/> I think I pulled out the tulips by the roots– or was it the irises? <br/> I never cared for irises anyway. <br/> I kept the roses though. <br/> I’m not that bitter. <br/> Even though my garden has becomes a graveyard <br/> Of our love, <br/> The roses look nice dancing along the hedge. <br/> And somewhere deep inside me I suspected I’ll need them one day <br/> That the day I can look at them without hurting <br/> Is the day your presence finally leaves my garden <br/> The day I’ll become a green thumb myself.
