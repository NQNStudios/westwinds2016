Tonight I taste the stars <br/> And feel the unfettered wind break <br/> While flower petals serenade me <br/> Tonight I see only beauty <br/> And taste pure bottled joy <br/> While contented hums the breeze <br/> Tonight I see beyond <br/> My whirlwind emotions <br/> Into the world still loves and lives <br/> Tonight I breathe fresh air again <br/> And my heart turns back from stone <br/> As river boaters compliment <br/> Tonight I learn to love a little <br/> And release my fear of death <br/> As I fall into peace once more <br/> No longer stifled by fate <br/> Nor in free-fall by design <br/> Tonight I find myself again <br/> And then in the moment <br/> Whence companeous <br/> Solitude has reclaimed me <br/> I shed my chains <br/> And walk unfettered <br/> On my own support <br/> So much lighter now <br/> Despair has gone <br/> Â  <br/>
