I sat in a nest of my clothes, <br/> Recently worn, not washed, but clean, <br/> Perched on the limb that is my bed, <br/> Wearing a friendly black t-shirt that <br/> Brushes my waist and hugs my back, <br/> Very soothingly, very smoothly <br/>   <br/> I sit in the light of the sunset now, <br/> Surrounded by tokens of Saturday evening: <br/> Cricket song, bird whistles, squirrel chirps, <br/> Speeding cars, barking dogs, and the rough <br/> Hum of mowers and edgers finishing up <br/> The day’s work of trimming away a week’s work <br/>   <br/> This elbow of the Aves is my momentary secret garden, <br/> This is the girl I mean to be, <br/> And the quail that crosses my path is my mother bird <br/> No cars pass me as I sit on the concrete curb <br/> Nothing stirs me from my placidity <br/>   <br/> It’s just me here, in the twilight air that reminds me a little of <br/> Resting my head on my sister’s back, sprawled before the fire, <br/> Or the scallion pancake-induced tears I shared with my cousin, <br/> Or even the late nights when I laid peacefully in my bed, <br/> Mostly awake, conscious of the cotton sheets across my belly, <br/> Their touch much better than yours. <br/>   <br/>   <br/>
