When the life has left her eyes <br/> What will you do then? <br/> Will you scream and cry? <br/> When she becomes clouded and cold <br/> What will you do then? <br/> Will you try to warm her? <br/>   <br/> She can no longer call your name <br/> So, what will you do? <br/> This is war <br/> And you're in the battlefield <br/> How could you let your dearest get caught? <br/> In this bloody crossfire? <br/>   <br/> Shall you beg me to give her back? <br/> Shame on you. <br/> Go ahead and clutch her to your chest <br/> It will do no good. <br/> I have taken your most precious <br/> And what's even better than that <br/> Is that you gave her to me. <br/> Who is the real villain here? <br/>   <br/> As she lifts her weak hand to your face <br/> Breathing her last breath <br/> Will she smile? <br/> When her body runs stiff <br/> What will you do then? <br/> You and I both know the truth <br/> You and I both know the answer <br/> You will do nothing <br/>   <br/> As her last gaze sets <br/> You will do nothing <br/> You will just stare back at her <br/> With that smug and callous face of yours. <br/> As you always have, with all the others <br/>   <br/> You will do nothing <br/> For you have realized <br/> You are too late <br/> That it is inevitable <br/> That I am inevitable <br/>   <br/> Now let us allow the cycle to resume. <br/>
