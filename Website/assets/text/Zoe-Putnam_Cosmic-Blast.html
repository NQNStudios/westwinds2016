If I should be reincarnated <br/> I should like to be a stone <br/> Be it be it azurite or gypsum <br/> In Europe or at home <br/> Why asked the weeping willow <br/> When you could be a tree <br/> Why asked the passing dolphin <br/> When you could have the sea <br/> To them a stone is nothing much <br/> An obstacle to pass <br/> But the desertâ€™s always called to me <br/> Be it crazy, be it crass <br/> Something deep inside of me <br/> Calls for me to go <br/> Within the desert <br/> To be welcomed home <br/> To feel the heat <br/> Of a cosmic blast <br/> To see the world from ages past <br/> Indeed, to be welcomed home <br/> At last
