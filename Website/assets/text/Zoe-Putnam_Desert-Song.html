This is a timeless land <br/> A land of secrets not quite heard <br/> A land of history <br/> Once known, now blurred <br/> A land where the sun beats down <br/> On ancient forested hills <br/> A land of mountain deserts <br/> A land of inhuman wills <br/> A land of stone like clay <br/> That echoes with the beat <br/> Of its shapers tools <br/> A land of extremes; of cold, of heat <br/> This is a land where my brothers serenade me <br/> With dark feathers and jarring cries <br/> Where the land itself holds you prisoner <br/> A land that shows you the impossible, then bids you—try <br/> A land where the silence of the desert, <br/> The earth rises up and sings <br/> Where even the creatures bound to the earth <br/> Suddenly take flight with wings <br/> This land has wrapped its arms around me <br/> A friend parted for far too long <br/> It taught me of the past; of those who walk where I now step <br/> It welcomed me in that timeless song <br/> It said this is a timeless land <br/> A land of ancient secrets not quite heard <br/> A land of history <br/> Once known, now blurred <br/> This land reached into my soul <br/> It grabbed on tight, and will never let go <br/> It hailed me in with a knowing smile <br/> And said in my heart, welcome home <br/>   <br/>
