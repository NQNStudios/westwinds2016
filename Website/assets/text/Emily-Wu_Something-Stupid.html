It's always something stupid. <br/>   <br/> An evening of lights and laughter, <br/> Of coffee shop smelling philosophies, <br/> Secret looks exchanged over the rims of adorable mugs, <br/> As warmth slowly spreads through my icy insides, <br/> Crisp winter chill still clinging to my skin, <br/> Reminding me the air outside is as cold and empty as the space between the moon and stars <br/> But while I'm here inside with your knee pressed against mine <br/> Fingers close but never touching, we'll both be alright. <br/> And then just like that the mood is gone, <br/> Like the star that just shot across the night and ripped its harmony in half. <br/> The smile's dropped off both of our faces, <br/> And our limbs connect in all the wrong places, <br/> Your kneecap knocking painfully into mine. <br/> I don't pretend I know where it went <br/> And you don't either, so we sit in silence. <br/> Maybe it was something I said, <br/> Or that silly face I made, <br/> Or perhaps I'd swallowed the conversation, <br/> With my latest sip of gingerbread latte. <br/> Maybe it's the way I can feel your interest in me sinking like that cream <br/> Disappearing into your hot chocolate, <br/> And I force myself to look out the frosty windowpane, <br/> The way you bite your tongue and I hold mine, <br/> And together both of us barely breathe <br/> Tiptoeing around the already shattered spell <br/> Neither of us want to acknowledge just yet <br/> Because we still retained a bit of the lights <br/> The laughter and the warmth even though the joy has ebbed away. <br/> Maybe it's the way you finally stand up, <br/> And wrap your scarf around your neck. <br/> The way you still refuse to meet my eyes when we say goodby, <br/> The way you don't once look back over your shoulder <br/> As you disappear into the dark silence <br/> And I'm left staring through the transparent door. <br/> Maybe it's the way your hot chocolate goes cold on the table <br/> And I walk home alone, <br/> Barefoot in the snow 'cause I just can't bother with heels anymore, <br/> And shivering, still in that perfect dress <br/> As I curl up in bed and stare up at the ceiling <br/> Too tired to throw away the scraps <br/> Of a perfectly good day, razed to the ground <br/> Because yours truly just couldn't hold it together. <br/>   <br/> It's always something stupid, isn't it? <br/>
