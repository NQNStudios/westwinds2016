<p class="P2"><a name="_GoBack"></a></p> <a name="_GoBack"></a> Two girls, both thin and blonde <br/> With pale eyes and that (fringed with lace) <br/> Sunk into the cream-pearl of skin hung over bone <br/> (Both laundry suspended on fishing wire swaying from gusts of the sun) <br/>   <br/> But just to differentiate <br/> Let’s give them each a different name <br/> Let’s call them Gold and Platinum <br/>   <br/> Gold had a wild mane (mangrove roots in dry river) <br/> That fell over broad shoulders to the dip in her back <br/> Her face (a heroes face) cast from clay broad nose wide mouth <br/> Bright teeth (she had spider hands that danced over buttons) <br/>   <br/> Platinum’s hair cropped short dyed pale stiff with wax no room for fingers <br/> Slim shoulders slim fingers slim thighs <br/> Her nose porcelain lips round (Cinderella needed rescuing) <br/> Doesn’t smile much. Arms wrap loosely around waist. <br/>   <br/> Gold wears band t-shirts high socks long hair wide grin <br/> Says life is easy says (with her eyes) <br/> Too much too far <br/> <p class="P4"></p> Platinum is. Worry. <br/> (folds into origami swans the chiaroscuro of white paper(skin) on black) <br/> just enough <br/>   <br/>   <br/> There was another girl. <br/> Name: Silver. <br/> Dark hair dark eyes ringed in feathers <br/> (Birdlike) pecks things apart leaves the pieces of her nets discarded twigs after hurricane. <br/>   <br/> Silver met Gold on cobblestone reached cold fingers beneath cotton pulled up and <br/> Under there was a shirt advertising despair and beneath that there was a shirt of four men’s faces and beneath that there was a blouse cast of white lace and – <br/>   <br/> And beneath that another and finally. <br/>   <br/> Silver pulled off a shirt for a doll (sparrow-bird) made of ice and it melted in her too-hot hands and Gold dripped onto asphalt and there was nothing, nothing, nothing. <br/>   <br/> But Silver met Platinum and she stopped to lift the fabric of her plain black t-shirt but instead she was caught in a web of iron thread (armor) and she looked closer and there were galaxies swimming in the netting and thousands of stars that were spiders and. <br/> (Cinderella was a knight) <br/>   <br/> So Platinum sat down. <br/>
