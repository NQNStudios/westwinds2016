The curtain’s drawing to a close <br/> And everyone’s obsessed with hanging onto the things they have spent a year whining about <br/> With clinging, just a little longer, to the devil they know <br/> And warding off the devil they don’t <br/> Or maybe it’s just <br/> Me <br/>   <br/> I’m flying over pools of darkness in a city that looks like Christmas lights draped across the Earth <br/> They can’t all be water, can they? <br/>   <br/> What did I do this year? <br/> What changed this year? <br/> Did I change this year? <br/> How much of it can I relive, if I try? <br/> How much of it can I get down, permanent, if I try? <br/>   <br/> And now we’re soaring through fog <br/> That courses past my window <br/> Sparkling like stardust <br/>   <br/> What do I want from next year? <br/> What do I want to hang on to? <br/> What do I want to forget? <br/> Am I scared? Excited? Sad? Nostalgic? Confused? Happy? <br/>   <br/> And everything outside my window has gone dark <br/> Except the occasional red flashes of light on the plane’s complicated metal wing <br/> I hope those are good red flashes <br/>   <br/> What am I supposed to do? <br/> Desperately try to do it all again, “one last time?”   <br/> Wait for the turn of the calendar with crossed fingers and bated breath? <br/> Say hasty goodbyes, and painful goodbyes, and every kind in between? <br/> Shed tears? <br/> Smile in anticipation? <br/>   <br/> I think I can make out something underneath the haze of dark clouds <br/> This vague spot of … otherness <br/> It’s fading in the distance now <br/> And now it’s gone <br/> Like this year, which has spilled through my fingers <br/> And taken an eternity <br/> And an instant <br/> Doing so <br/>   <br/> I want so much to be different next year <br/> I want it to be quick, painless, <br/> And I want it to last forever, and feel every minute of it <br/> I want to remember so much of this year <br/> For the rest of my life <br/> And some tiny, scared, tired part of me wants to stay here forever <br/> With my ghosts and regrets and longings and mistakes <br/> With my laughter and love and accomplishments and risks and growth <br/>   <br/> Outside of the red flashes, I see nothing <br/> Nothing but a velvet black curtain, inches from the stage’s floor <br/> Nothing but a void <br/> Beckoning, the menace within it a-grin <br/> And whispering, “It’s all up to you, kid. <br/> Endless possibilities. <br/> All yours.” <br/>   <br/> What’s next? <br/>   <br/>
