In here, I’m nothing

I’ll say it again: that I’m ashes, 

and that the earth is too pure, too

blue to take me with these scratches

<br />

the scars of falling down on my knees the 

first time I rode a bike

and the burns of all the lies I have

held in my heart

<br />

I know I’ll die by flames of my 

own damnation

but if a white earth won’t take me, hell 

will just have to do.
