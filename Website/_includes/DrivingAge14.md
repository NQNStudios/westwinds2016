She could drive! Sure, there had been that one time with the tree… okay and she had that mailbox… twice. But those were small details. No one really cared about little taints like that. No one except Mya’s dictator parents that was. So here she was, destined to be a social outcast and have her life totally over just because her father had declared Mya a “danger to herself, and more importantly: the car”. It had taken a screaming argument and a vicious game of tug-of-war between her and her dad. But she had been parted from her pink keys, or in her mind, her livelihood, in one day. As if to add insult to injury Mya’s favorite key chain had still been attached too. 

The teen had never been one to take such abuse of power lying down though. It had taken a few hours of pouting and slamming doors as hard as she could, but Mya had a plan. She wasn’t going to be stuck inside while all her other friends were out driving and having fun.

Hours later with an unlucky mail box under her tires and the stolen pink keys still dangling from the ignition, Mya sighed. 

Maybe she couldn’t drive so well after all.
