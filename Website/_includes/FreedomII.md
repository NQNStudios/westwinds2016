What fuels happiness? One’s own desires, passions, and inspirations. We channel these and act upon them to satisfy our thirst for accomplishment and success, or just to have a good time. Freedom acts as the means to reach that happiness, as a bridge we cross to find enjoyment. It allows us to use anything and everything we have to do more, gain more, be more. Freedom gives us the time and space we exist in, to be where we chose when we choose it.

Freedom exists as a concept as deep as love. For some, it’s just as hard to find.
