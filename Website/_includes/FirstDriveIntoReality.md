Nobody said it was going to be easy. Life throws you so many curve balls. Life throws you so many distractions so that you won’t think about what life really is. Don’t be stupid. Open Your Eyes. Don’t be concentrated on just *one* thing. Pay attention to your surroundings, and pay attention to the people you tell your business too. 

Life is tough. Strangers turn into friends… but friends turn into foes and slowly, foes turn jealous. My advice to you, is to keep your circle small and be true to yourself. Because reality hits you. It hits you in a blink of an eye. Friends turn into snakes. You can’t trust anybody now a days. Have your own back, and never eat with people you didn’t starve with. Never ride with the people you didn’t walk with. Be true to yourself. Be true to your TRUE friends. Open your eyes and see reality.
