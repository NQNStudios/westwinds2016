The single apple hung motionlessly from a thin string. Though not mouth-watering in color, or prominent in size, the apple was the main attraction in an otherwise vacant room.

Vacant, that is, except for the girl.

Ten or eleven, wearing a tattered lace dress that might have once been yellow. Wide, innocent eyes.

The bleak room had no chairs, tables, windows, or doors. Just one apple, and one girl.

She shuffled toward the apple curiously. Her eyes examined the glossy red-orange skin and the shape of it was reflected in her dilated pupils. Each time she inhaled, the faint sweet scent filled her nose. The tip of her tongue lapped the edge of her lips. She wanted to eat the fruit, but she merely gazed upon it with carefully exercised restraint. Her small hands came under the apple to cup it. The thumbs rubbed against the surface once.

With the apple still clutched in her grasp, the girl took a few steps back, so that the string tightened at an angle. She opened her hands and the apple swung back and forth. It swung again and again, the arc gradually narrowing. Eventually it was, once again, stone still.

The shirtless man in the tattoo parlor shifted impatiently. “How long is this going to take? I’m kind of on a schedule.”

“I’m almost done.” The tattoo woman assured him. “Good work takes time.”

Not surprisingly, the woman was spotted irregularly in tattoos. She wore heavy eyeliner, and one side of her bright red hair was shaved off.

She stepped back and admired the man’s back, the entirety of it glistening where the black ink had soaked into his skin. It was one of her best jobs, no doubt, with complicated geometric shapes crossing each other in detailed fractals. This wasn’t the man’s first tattoo—colorful patches of ink sleeved his arms, legs, and even his bald head.

The artist leveled her needle in a few final touches before using her phone to snap a picture of the finished project.

“All done. Wanna see?” She asked her subject.

As if he didn’t feel the pain of the fresh tattoo, the man rose abruptly from the chair. “Of course I do.”

The woman held her phone up with the screen pointing toward the man. His eyes raked up and down the small picture harshly. An angry red flushed his face and neck.

“Are you kidding me?!” He demanded loudly. “What did you do?”

The artist appeared unfazed by his shouting. “What’s wrong?”

“This.” He shouted, gesturing to the image of the finished tattoo, a robotic snake curled around a bar. “This is a snake!”

“Yes, it is.” She replied.

“I asked for an apple! Not this!”

Eerily calmly, the artist stood. She stepped close to the man, and a steel came into her eyes. “I gave you what you truly wanted. Nothing more, nothing less.”

“I’m not paying for this!” He spat.

“I’m not asking for your money.” She explained.

He fumed for a few seconds, unsure how to reply. “Screw this.” He finally muttered. “Screw you.”

Pulling on his shirt heatedly, the man stormed out the glass door.

All was silent for a moment in the parlor. 

The artist picked up her needle gun again. She sat in the chair.

The gun hummed and pricked the tender skin of her inner arm. Guided by a steady hand, the ink left a calligraphic trail of neat cursive.

> “Don’t take the apple if you can’t take the snake.”

A small smile played at her lips as the woman laid down her gun.

The man walked in a drunken haze down the middle of the road. After what he now called “the apple incident,” he had ridden his Harley Davidson down to his favorite pub and poured out his troubles to several glasses of Jack and Coke.

“Dirty rotten…no good…” He grumbled to the passing cars.

One honked and swerved to avoid hitting him.

“Oh, go drive off a cliff!” He made an obscene gesture.

Wanting a change in scenery, the man stumbled to the grass on the side of the road. He belched. His foot found its way to a tree root and his arms made no attempt to catch him as he fell, face forward, into the dirt.

“Oh.” He slurred. “This is nice.”

A black cat meandered across the grass in front of him. It stopped to paw at a lone yellow dandelion, momentarily glancing up to regard him curiously.

The man huffed. “Nice try, buddy. But I already got my streak of bad luck today, thank you very much.”

It tilted its head. Black paws carefully padded forward. Its green eyes looked into his, and its pink tongue lapped at its lips. Then it opened its mouth and spoke in a voice like a purr.

“An apple is a snake in disguise.”

The man’s eyes narrowed and his lips puckered. “I must be more drunk than I thought.

The cat walked past the man on the ground, fondling his face with its tail before leaving his range of sight.

“If only you knew, human.” He heard it call as it left.

He snorted. “Dumb cat. Thinks it can speak English.”

He pondered briefly if it was worth the effort to get up and look at his surroundings before deciding in the affirmative. After all, there might be some place to eat nearby.

Momentarily forgetting about the newly inked tattoo, he rolled heavily onto his back and howled in pain. A grunt of disgust followed shortly after.

Using his elbows, he pushed himself up to a sitting position. His beady eyes scanned the street and shops around it. A few clothing stores, a theater, nothing too promising.

Ah. There. A taco stand. Tacos sounded lovely right now.

It was behind him and it took quite a bit of effort to stand up and turn around, but spurred by the savory aromas in the air, the man eventually tripped his way to the front of the small booth. Manning the grill was a small Hispanic man with a curly moustache. His work day had been monotonously insignificant, and he was quite captivated by the obviously drunk man who talked to cats.

“Oh, so you are alive, after all!” The vendor chuckled. “I was beginning to think you died on the side of the road.”

The drunk man shot him an offended look, though he didn’t know what the vendor had said to offend him. “I wanna burrito.” He slurred.

“Sure thing, *hermano*.”

With expertise that comes only from years of experience, he quickly cooked and assembled a wrap with meat, lettuce, and tomatoes and wrapped it in a square of parchment paper. The drunk man mumbled a hasty thanks and pulled a wad of bills from his pocket to pay. “Keep the change.” He added.

“Thanks, *amigo!” The vendor grinned toothily. “Oh, and one more thing. If you eat it, you’ll die.”

The drunk knit his brows in confusion. He had only been subconsciously comprehending the conversation, but a dull alarm sounded from the recesses of his head. “What did you say?”

“You heard me.” Still grinning cheerily. “If you eat it, you’ll die.”

The drunk squinted. “No…I won’t.”

An indifferent shrug. “Your funeral.”

The man weighed his options briefly before his ravenous hunger got the best of him. He blew air out of his mouth dismissively. Peeling back the parchment around the tortilla, he took a greedily huge bite.

He chewed. Swallowed. Nothing happened, just as he had thought.

“See? I’m fine. Perfectly fine.” He sneered.

Then the burrito started to hiss like a snake. No, like dozens of snakes. A whole clan.

With delayed, drunken reaction, the man gazed down at the burrito in his hands. At first, he thought he had been drugged. Surely the distorted vision before him couldn’t be real. But anyone, delirious with alcohol or sober, could have seen it. A dark red fluid oozed out of the tortilla and spilled over onto the man’s hand, just as a taste of iron filled his mouth.

Horrified, he dropped it on the ground. The impact caused the liquid to spurt out of it, splattering his feet and legs with crimson droplets, and a pool of the liquid formed around it.

Suddenly his senses became sharp and aware. In a moment, he considered the impact of the situation, trying to convince himself it was all a dream. That was the only plausible explanation.

As if an air bag had been deflated, the man felt his insides collapse. His knees buckled, and for the second time that day he fell to the floor again, landing hard on his back. This time though, the superficial pain of the new tattoo was the least of his worries. He found himself unable to breathe, and with it came a searing pain that filled him.

Desperately, he directed his gaze upward. Though his vision was blurry, he could still make out the vendor’s sad, almost disappointed stare.

“You…what have you done?” The man rasped pitifully.

The vendor shrugged helplessly. “I did warn you.”

The man on the floor made a strange gurgling noise in the back of his throat. The closest he had been to death was a motorcycle accident a few years ago. That was rather like now: in the moments before he had been wheeled into the hospital, his senses had dulled and he had gotten a feeling as if he were in suspense, at the top of a pendulum waiting for it to drop. It never did. But now was the moment.

High-pitched ringing was all he heard, and a field of red was all he saw. He blinked twice, attempting to regain some control over himself.

And the pendulum completed its terminal swing.

A tattoo artist walked up to the stand. She wore heavy eyeliner, and one side of her bright red hair was shaved off.

She prodded curiously at the man lying still on the floor, then looked at the taco vendor inquisitively.

“I did warn him,” He repeated helplessly.

“I know.” She said. “I did too.”

The girl in the faded yellow dress had plucked the apple off of its string. She eyed it hungrily.

Gingerly, she touched her teeth to it and broke the skin. She apple now had a small bite missing.

Strangely, the apple’s inside matched it’s skin in color. Red. But this red was dark, rich, and liquid. A dark red fluid oozed out of the apple and spilled over onto the girl’s hand, just as a taste of iron filled her mouth.

She licked her lips and took another bite.
