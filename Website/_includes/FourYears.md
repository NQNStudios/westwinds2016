Four years of believing.

"I love you so much"

Did you really?

Conversations dwindled down to one-word responses.

I stopped being a priority, 

The bottom of the list.

You only stuck around when you were bored.

Why did you insist on leading me on?

Who are you to do that to someone?

*

Four years of fawning over you.

"I wanted to kiss you all the time"

Then why didn't you?

We fit like two perfect puzzle pieces,

I was your best friend.

Butterflies fluttered when you appeared,

I was your number one fan.

You were the sunshine in the grey sky,

I was head over heels in love.

*

Four years of tearing myself down.

"You are so beautiful."

You said, looking at my body.

Always my body,

"Your legs are so soft"

Thanks, I too love the feel of razor burn.

"Keep your hair long, I like it better."

Thanks, I didn't know locks of dead cells enhanced your love.

You were so superficial, 

"You are 10/10"

Depriving myself of the bare necessities,

Refusing to be complimented by others,

Never believing I was enough,

Hating my body, hating my self.

Just to fit your definition of "beautiful"

*

Four years of tears, dripping down my face.

Sleepless nights accompanied with trust falls with the devil.

I trusted you with my life,

But you never looked back.

My sanity crumbled,

Thinking that this was the norm.

Water droplets creating an endless stream,

Deep into the night.

Excusing your behavior, 

Treating you like the victim.

"He's afraid of losing his friends."

I was afraid of losing you.

*

"He's worried about getting hurt."

I was worried about getting hurt.

"He's just terrified of having his heart broken"

I was so terrified of you breaking my heart.

The difference between you and I,

The one thing that sets us apart,

Is that I stopped being scared.

I ceased to care what others might think,

Stopped thinking about getting hurt,

Ended all thought that you would even dare break my heart.

I trusted you with my emotions,

I trusted you with my life.

*

Four years of indecisiveness.

Who could say those things,

And then leave the next day?

Who could lift me up so high,

Just to let go when I needed you the most?

You were always a roadblock in my way,

But you never wanted to clear the path.

I stopped believing in happily ever afters,

Made it feel like they were just a dream.

I can't believe I trusted you,

My heart broken beyond repair. 

I can't believe the words that left your mouth.

They were all twisted versions of the truth,

Exploiting my na√Øvety for your own personal gain,

You didn't really mean any of it,

You just wanted someone to bang.
