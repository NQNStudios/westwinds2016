I live in a world that's always loud. I live in a colorful place that's always dull. 

I live in a sea of robots that are living, but not quite living.

They tell you stories when you're little. They tell you of fantasies and paradises, things that make you want to grow up to have, Why are all of the stories lies?

Why? Why? Why?

Why did they show us those vivid pictures and read us those beautiful words? Why did they get our hopes up just to let us down? There isn't always a happy ending. Not all of us want a prince, and we don't need to be saved by one.

I can't believe that when I was little I wanted to grow up to be the damsle. Now I'm in distress but im no damsle, I'm just depressed. Depressed that I'm going into the real world and seeing how it really is.

You know, it really makes me laugh. I remember very clearly the stories I was told and sometimes I said I never wanted to grow up, but I also said I couldn't wait to grow up either. My mother and father would tell me to stay little, stay young, never grow up. 

It's not as fun as you think, they said when I turned thirteen. Don't grow up, don't grow up, the stories are a lie. Don't grow up, stay our little girl, stay our little girl.

Now I wish I could go back. Back to the stories, the lies of my childhood that made my nights good. Maybe it's not to late to go back and run away with Peter Pan, or to follow the rabbit down the hole to Wonderland. Maybe it's not to late to go back and live in my storybooks of lies.
