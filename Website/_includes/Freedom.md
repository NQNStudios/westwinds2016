Ink stained skin. This is a freedom. Colored hair. This is a freedom. Painted on nails, painted on faces, freedom and freedom. Doing what you choose to do with yourself is freedom. Being free is something dear to all, yet freedom can be a dangerous thing. Words are powerful things that can be freely and also carelessly thrown around. Freedom of speech is something that not all people have a luxury of, and of those who have this freedom, it is seemingly almost abused. Spreading hatred and pain. Freedom is something that should always be accompanied by morality. The freedom to do what you would like, while still keeping peace. Dye your hair, get a tattoo, paint your nails and put on your make-up. Get your piercings and listen to your music and say what you would like to say. Just be moral enough to know that you choose how you want to live with freedom and others will choose differently and that is okay. Your opinions are yours, keep them away from otherâ€™s lives and their choices and live your free life without disrupting the free life of another.
