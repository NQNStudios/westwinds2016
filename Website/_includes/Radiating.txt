<p>. Petals So Soft .</p>

<p>You Avoid touch because the Oil on your Fingertips could Damage.</p>

. Petals So Soft . 

You Avoid conscious thoughts because You Want To Be Selfish.

. Petals So Soft . 

You know Time takes things, So you know You must Enjoy This.

. Petals So Soft .

You Inhale All That she is 

. So Luscious .

In All the While, her Petals Radiate 

. So Precious .

She knows how her petals Curl

Knows what Makes her Pollen Grow

Knows the way her Stem Bestows

With that comes the knowledge of which she will Never Owe

Not to Anyone

Neither Friend or Foe

The Sepal she owns holds the Memory 

of all that she has ever known. 

But does she know the Gift that she Gives when that wind blows?

Doesn’t she know how Beautifully she’ll Grow?

When her Pedals fully Uncurl

. Feeding Colors to The World . 

Making the Hallow

. Unhallowed .

Ultimately . . . She Knows 

From the Countless attempts from Being Picked.        

From the Gloomy Weather and the 

. Sorrow .

By being herself By

. Radiating .

Ultimately . . . She Knows 

. The Sun Will Follow .
