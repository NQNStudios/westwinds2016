Understanding. Understanding is the biggest goal. In order to succeed you must know. Not all understanding is knowledge. Curiosity is not followed by understanding. Five year old German girls must go to school like everyone else. Learning the “normal” of society, understanding how life ticks. Blending in, doing nothing wrong, looking and focusing on understanding to succeed. Until piano.

Another lesson, exactly like school. Piano takes more understanding, more knowledge. Curiosity is paused because teacher tell you how to understand, no stupid questions.

A single 4.37 foot tall, blonde, blue-eyed girl sit down at a piano bench nervously.

“Play something,” she stares up at the middle-aged lady, who in return continues rereading something written in invisible ink on the black and white keys.

“Bbbut I ddon’t know how yet…” Stammered the embarrassed student.

“Yes actually you do, darling.” Miss Lynn’s eyes finally focused on the small child, searching her face, perplexed.

Little Susie turns slowly facing the keys. She presses the heavy wooden known, as a very soft noise comes from the baby grand strings. She smiled. She can choose what she wants to do. She controls this instrument. She looked up as Miss Lynn encourages her, “See? God job! Don’t stop!” The small student sat there for fifteen minutes playing unmatched tunes, a scramble of dynamics and notations creating an incomparable love of creativity and a very original composition in Susie’s heart.

“You’ve done a wonderful job today! I can’t wait to see you next week.”

Piano was her first love, from five till forever. That little girl found a freedom, a break, a passion.

Me? Yes, well, I’m little Susie. I feel head over heels for music, my teacher introduced me and is my biggest fan, my hero! Eleven years later and eight instruments later I still spend endless hours expressing and feeling emotion through my music, God’s gift to the earth, my joy, my survival.
