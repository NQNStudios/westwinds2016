<div class="work-text">
Walking through an empty battlefield full of land mines hidden under parched earth; I’m very cautious about where I place my feet. <br/> For a week now, I haven’t set one off and it scares me, <br/> I’m holding my breath; I left my gas mask on the other side of the trench. <br/> Last week, I was too confident about my foot placements, <br/> There was an explosion every time I least expected it. <br/> It makes me so mad he breaks the alliance of father and daughter so easily; <br/> My father won’t even admit there’s something wrong with him. <br/> Last week, I stepped on too many land mines; every time I came home from a night out with my friends. <br/> I looked forward to the weekends, but at the same time, they are no man’s land <br/> And I’m hurdling out of control, trying to dodge the bullets. <br/> They are either filled with him blowing up about somebody not putting away that one dish <br/> Or him passive aggressively hiding in the trench. <br/> Hour after hour, your piercing words pour out of you without needing to reload. <br/> You let your grenade go off in your hand; <br/> You would rather be a suicide bomber than let someone else have the last word. <br/> But this week has been terribly quiet and I feel the presence of a vulture circling above me, <br/> Just waiting for me to trip onto one of those land mines. <br/> And it scares me.

<div class="work-title">My Lemon Tree by Alexander Cooper</div>
<div class="work-text">
In my garden, there is a lemon tree. <br/> The trunk is sleek and sturdy, <br/> And the leaves float like puffs of clouds. <br/> The fruit is sweet as candy, <br/> And sour as is sweet. <br/> In the perfect shape a lemon should be, <br/> Round and twisted at the edges. <br/>   <br/> And the warmth of the spring, <br/> And the rain of the spring, <br/> Brought only more to the garden, <br/> Sunflowers bloomed across the lawn, <br/> Moving to follow the ball of light, <br/> Sunny petals moving in and out, <br/> And sturdy green stems rolling. <br/>   <br/> Soon grape vines wrap the fence, <br/> Twisting through the fence’s holds, <br/> The green offset by speckles of purple, <br/> Adding layers of beauty to the previous garden, <br/> That could warm anyone’s heart. <br/>   <br/> And the frosting on the cake was nothing but perfect, <br/> As strawberry bushes took their corners, <br/> Like holiday lights strung with joy, <br/> The itself was juicy and sweet. <br/>   <br/> And a plant, dense and efficient <br/> Began to grow, <br/> A dandelion of sorts, <br/> But I, with my naive nature, thought <br/> Weeds are flowers too, <br/> And the next day, when I went outside, <br/> Two dandelions had taken its place. <br/> <p class="P1"><a name="_GoBack"></a></p> <a name="_GoBack"></a> The dandelions roared, swarming the garden, <br/> The strawberries no longer tasted sweet, <br/> They were hard and dry inside, <br/> The carnations withered and died, <br/> Their petals shriveled and turned like rust, <br/> The grape vines thinned like on undernourished, <br/> And the grapes shrunk until nonexistence, <br/> And the sunflowers closed, never to open again, <br/> Saying goodbye to the sun. <br/>   <br/> There was nothing left, <br/> Other than me, <br/> And, of course, my trusty lemon tree.

<div class="work-title">An Elder Tale by Cheri Brisendine</div>
<div class="work-text">
<span class="T3">The windows of the house looked kind and warm at night, <br/>the way they leaked the yellow light of home <br/>out onto the rocks, grass, and trees. <br/>They seemed suspended in the night, like beacons of hope, reminders of love. <br/>To make one and all feel loved and at home. <br/>The yellow light spilled out onto the street, <br/>cheerful and welcoming, acting like a candle to all the lost and lonely souls<br/>—the moths of the human race.

It hurt to turn away but she did, eventually; <br/>she turned from that warm light, denying the remorse, the hate. <br/>It was behind her now, that light. <br/>She couldn’t go back, no matter the warmth, the welcome. <br/>The calamity in her soul forbid it and as <br/>she walked from the house, each small step a feat, <br/>her eyes filled with tears. <br/>The whispers of darkness pricked at her ears but she kept walking. <br/>The promise of depth, the whimper of lost hope, tickled her consciousness. <br/></span>Come<span class="T3">, it murmured into her being, <br/>its ghost-like, chilly tendrils dragging her <br/>further and further into the dark masses of loss. <br/></span>Come to us.

At first, she ignored the sweet talk, <br/>ignored the wonderful mutter, she held her <br/>livelihood close to her, safe. <br/>But the talk changed to song, <br/>with such wondrous dark beauty, fluctuating, <br/>wearing down on her mind, <br/>clogging her thoughts with senselessness, <br/>she was worked into forthcoming. <br/></span>Talk<span class="T3">, the melody demanded. <br/></span>Talk to us.

She spoke her words of vice, <br/>spoke the bitterness that she did not feel but knew to be true. <br/>She spoke, and her voice grew and <br/>she yelled and her voice died and <br/>she whimpered. <br/>She whimpered the misdealing of her youth, <br/>the misguiding of her adulthood. <br/>She yelled her disregard for amore, <br/>and told of her passion for innocence, injustice. <br/>She spoke of the vague mist of her life, and she did not cry. </span>

Finally, she kneeled, stopped walking, <br/>fell into the darkness with mirth and poise. <br/>Finally, she had begun her descent<br/>into what she knew was coming; <br/>she welcomed the dust much as she had the <br/>yellow light long before. <br/>Finally, she slept.</span>

<div class="work-title">Our Garden by Emily Wu</div>
<div class="work-text">
Our garden hasn’t been much of a garden, <br/> Every since you left. <br/> You were always the green thumb out of the two of us <br/> And I’m sure you knew somewhere in the back of your mind <br/> When you packed up your suitcase and left it all behind <br/> That to leave this garden to me is basically <br/> The equivalent of condemning it to death. <br/> And I guess you didn’t really care. <br/> After all, you’re the green thumb. <br/> New flowers will grow where you will go. <br/>   <br/> I regret to say that in the months following your departure <br/> I had even less mind to garden. <br/> It sounded pathetic to my friends and even to myself <br/> But every blade of grass, every bud of multi-colored tulip <br/>Made me think of you<br />And it burned me as much as the hot July sun <br/> Made the flowers wither. <br/> So I retreated back to our room (now completely mine) <br/> And I shut myself up like the coward I am. <br/>   <br/> I didn’t have the heart <br/> To let the roses we planted together die, though. <br/> Every time I thought to leave them to decay, <br/> I’d look up from my poems <br/> (I write them a lot now. <br/> I figure it’s better for my health than tubs of ice-cream) <br/> And out the window and I’ll hear your voice <br/> The day we buried the seeds into the ground, <br/> Remember the way your fingers brushed against mine <br/> And suddenly I’ll feel the urge to water those roses <br/> With my tears. <br/>   <br/> If you were here you’d have lamented at the mess I made <br/> Of the flowerbeds <br/> The year I tried to replant the petunias <br/> When they didn’t reappear in the summer. <br/> You’d have laughed at the effort I made, <br/> Hours and hours of research that somehow <br/> Ended with me on my knees in a mess of tears and dirt <br/> Bruised and bloody and tired. <br/>   <br/> I questioned myself that day <br/> For the first time in years. <br/> Wondered why I was replanting the petunias. <br/> I have a natural aversion to flowers, as I’m sure you remember, <br/> Called a pollen allergy <br/> And here I was on my hands and knees, <br/> Attempting to preserve the pollen-producing devils. <br/>   <br/> I came to a realization that day: <br/> I was doing it for you. <br/> Even though you were thousands of miles away <br/> Probably tending to your own garden <br/> With your new love and your new life <br/> Not even sparing a thought for me, <br/> I was thinking of you, <br/> I had spent the last three years thinking about you. <br/> I’d kept the roses alive, didn’t I? <br/>   <br/>I also came to the realization that this is my garden now. <br/> That you left me three years ago.<br />And you left this garden with me. <br/> It struck me that I could do whatever I wished with it. <br/> So I did. <br/>   <br/> The petunias didn’t come back. <br/> I think I pulled out the tulips by the roots– or was it the irises? <br/> I never cared for irises anyway. <br/> I kept the roses though. <br/> I’m not that bitter. <br/> Even though my garden has becomes a graveyard <br/> Of our love, <br/> The roses look nice dancing along the hedge. <br/> And somewhere deep inside me I suspected I’ll need them one day <br/> That the day I can look at them without hurting <br/> Is the day your presence finally leaves my garden <br/> The day I’ll become a green thumb myself.

Apollo's servant claims he sees better through the bottom of his glass, <br/> That existence is more genial when observed through tinted lenses, <br/> That humanity itself is abstract, <br/> And therefore no God can lay a finger on him for his transgression of doubt <br/> When even the gods are but poor sinners not unlike himself. <br/> He claims he renounces conviction <br/> In divinity, in virtue, in love, in even himself, <br/> In anything except the bottles in his hand and the coin in his purse <br/> And the knowledge that absinthe-coaxed lethargy will one day peddle <br/> The very last hours of his existence to sleep. <br/> This he declares to be the only purpose of his life: to die <br/> And thus he denounces himself, <br/> Scorns the importance of his hands and their use <br/> Even as others scorn his ungainly feet and unkempt mind. <br/>   <br/> But in the face of Apollo's ravaged altar <br/> He claims he believes in the prophecies of Delphi <br/> Arise from slumber with eyes rimmed red <br/> Teeth and tongue in discord <br/> As he perjures himself to a court of worldly justice <br/> To the gatekeepers of the valley of the shadow of death <br/> Beseeches steel and flint that he may perish at Apollo's feet <br/> As more worthy men than him have done. <br/> For the self-proclaimed cynic is intoxicated by his own irony: <br/> His mind may demand ambiguity when it came to prophecies <br/> But his heart still loves Apollo, <br/> Marble, unmoved Apollo <br/> Whose belief and disposition is so different from his own <br/> That he cannot help but admire. <br/> His ardor his only conviction <br/> And that conviction stronger than the foundations of the stars <br/> That though he deemed little to be the absolute truth <br/> The cynic was the truest believer.

<div class="work-text">
Drop your sword. It’s almost as though you think you can match me, defeat me. O, fool! You already tried to match me, word for word, but you spun out and spit flames. Did you miss a meeting? All the meetings? I am Lilith, the unbridled, the dominant. The progeny of Adam carry no guard against me, have no weapon to topple me out of the air. You are the epitome of weakness! Weakness in ignorance, weakness in arrogance, every true frailty in existence... <br/>   <br/> Once I held breath and refused to speak my mind; now I pray for air to utter all things I have to say against you. Yes, had I breath to unleash this brain upon you! And yet, in my supposed limits, I will try; and that is the primary difference between you and I: willingness. That is why I am queen. <br/>   <br/> As ruling monarch, all I want is to watch you sink to your knees, as your heavy heart drags you down. But I worry: do you dwell in waters so shallow I must drown you by hand? <br/>   <br/> You have nothing. You speak nothing. You think nothing. And that is what tempts me to slip into your head and sow seeds, and what allows me to creep into your chambers in the night and slash to pieces your body... Your own foolishness is my sword. <br/>   <br/> I bathed in balm and I drank peppermint, I moved like aspens in a canyon. The sun was not quite up when I broke into a run, nor when I returned. I was on the finish line before you were ever awake.  I washed in the sunrise, where you could not see. I filled my heart, poured it out, cyclically performed it all again; I learned charm, I learned pain, I learned camouflage and revenge. What do you think I am here for? I once graced you with my glance, now I shall wither you with it. <br/>   <br/> And when I called myself queen, I wasn’t being clever. I was sincere. Look into my eyes. See the storm? yes, you do – but where are your seawalls? Foolish of you to think you could sail, coast any day of your life. <br/>   <br/> You are faint, your defenses feeble. You were never called to attention before, you never slogged through mud or bled from your pores. Your stunning ignorance of your bulwark makes you still weaker. You poor trout. Salome danced, I don’t have to. I can get you now. I will feast on you, though your name sears my very tongue. <br/>   <br/> Any pain dealt will be returned. You will simmer, boil, burn in every tear you ever made me shed, made anyone shed. This is Lilith’s oath, and deities never lie.

<div class="work-title">Trust by Sophie Valdez</div>
<div class="work-text">
Trust isn’t something given away for free, <br/> It should be earned, but I made the mistake. <br/> I trusted to fast and far too easily, <br/> And what did I get?  I got quite the pain. <br/>   <br/> And of course they lied, <br/> And they took my trust, <br/> And they tried to cry, <br/> But turned it to dust. <br/>   <br/> So their cries aren’t heard, <br/> Not registered and I’m free. <br/> I don’t need someone so sure <br/> They know what’s best for me. <br/>   <br/> So my sharp words, <br/> May they cut like a knife, <br/> To make them hurt <br/> Like I did that fateful night

<div class="work-title">Sick by Wes Orton</div>
<div class="work-text">
I sit in my room, <br/> Or shall I say my prison cell? <br/> With every cough, the agitation of my throat stirs a resting beast within my larynx. <br/> My long forsaken sinuses prevent any semblance of sensory stimulation or pleasure in food, the one thing of which a teenage boy should never be able to get enough. <br/> Cold medicine flows into my system like a waterfall of over-the-counter wishes and dreams, and yet no relief has been achieved. <br/> I beg, please, God, or whatever otherworldly fatewright looks down on me today, let this end! <br/> And yet, here I lie, feverish, unhappy and alone, <br/> Sick.

<div class="work-title">Cosmic Blast by Zoe Putnam</div>
<div class="work-text">
If I should be reincarnated <br/> I should like to be a stone <br/> Be it be it azurite or gypsum <br/> In Europe or at home <br/> Why asked the weeping willow <br/> When you could be a tree <br/> Why asked the passing dolphin <br/> When you could have the sea <br/> To them a stone is nothing much <br/> An obstacle to pass <br/> But the desert’s always called to me <br/> Be it crazy, be it crass <br/> Something deep inside of me <br/> Calls for me to go <br/> Within the desert <br/> To be welcomed home <br/> To feel the heat <br/> Of a cosmic blast <br/> To see the world from ages past <br/> Indeed, to be welcomed home <br/> At last

<div class="work-title">Desert Song by Zoe Putnam</div>
<div class="work-text">
This is a timeless land <br/> A land of secrets not quite heard <br/> A land of history <br/> Once known, now blurred <br/> A land where the sun beats down <br/> On ancient forested hills <br/> A land of mountain deserts <br/> A land of inhuman wills <br/> A land of stone like clay <br/> That echoes with the beat <br/> Of its shapers tools <br/> A land of extremes; of cold, of heat <br/> This is a land where my brothers serenade me <br/> With dark feathers and jarring cries <br/> Where the land itself holds you prisoner <br/> A land that shows you the impossible, then bids you—try <br/> A land where the silence of the desert, <br/> The earth rises up and sings <br/> Where even the creatures bound to the earth <br/> Suddenly take flight with wings <br/> This land has wrapped its arms around me <br/> A friend parted for far too long <br/> It taught me of the past; of those who walk where I now step <br/> It welcomed me in that timeless song <br/> It said this is a timeless land <br/> A land of ancient secrets not quite heard <br/> A land of history <br/> Once known, now blurred <br/> This land reached into my soul <br/> It grabbed on tight, and will never let go <br/> It hailed me in with a knowing smile <br/> And said in my heart, welcome home

<div class="work-title">I Taste the Stars Tonight by Zoe Putnam</div>
<div class="work-text">
Tonight I taste the stars <br/> And feel the unfettered wind break <br/> While flower petals serenade me <br/> Tonight I see only beauty <br/> And taste pure bottled joy <br/> While contented hums the breeze <br/> Tonight I see beyond <br/> My whirlwind emotions <br/> Into the world still loves and lives <br/> Tonight I breathe fresh air again <br/> And my heart turns back from stone <br/> As river boaters compliment <br/> Tonight I learn to love a little <br/> And release my fear of death <br/> As I fall into peace once more <br/> No longer stifled by fate <br/> Nor in free-fall by design <br/> Tonight I find myself again <br/> And then in the moment <br/> Whence companeous <br/> Solitude has reclaimed me <br/> I shed my chains <br/> And walk unfettered <br/> On my own support <br/> So much lighter now <br/> Despair has gone

<div class="work-title">The Audacity of Flowers by Zoe Putnam</div>
<div class="work-text">
The world weeps today <br/> Tears that fall unwelcome <br/> From the heaven’s dour eye <br/> Upon a stony ground <br/> We have dispersed <br/> To cover the mirrors <br/> With black mourning cloth <br/> So that the dead may pass on <br/> We put away our sunlit hues <br/> To don black mourning garb <br/> And stare shocked <br/> At the audacity of flowers <br/> As the heavens dress in <br/> Baleful black and let go <br/> Of river tears <br/> The flowers don their brightest robes <br/> And the grass takes out <br/> Its greenest gown <br/> To dry the heaven’s tears

<div class="work-title">The Wish Keeper's Attic by Zoe Putnam</div>
<div class="work-text">
My father told me a tale <br/> When I was very small <br/> Of the wish keeper’s attic <br/> To the left of the hall <br/> There with dusty clumps of hope <br/> And spider webs of envious thought <br/> Lives an old wizened man <br/> Granting wishes for naught <br/> Beauty or love he’ll give by the gallon <br/> He has shelves full of joy to spare <br/> Give him a visit if you think it wise <br/> In the attic beneath the old stair <br/> He’ll grant you a boon <br/> With a smile, and wink <br/> He has a fountain of youth <br/> And he’ll willingly give you a drink <br/> He keeps a box full of wishes <br/> Tucked just out of sight <br/> And if you look close enough in the corner, <br/> You can see a dream’s mellow light <br/> That wizened granter of wishes <br/> And withered keeper of gold <br/> All of his goods are easily bought <br/> His starting price, a single secret told
