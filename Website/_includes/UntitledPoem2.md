My childhood was laced with images of men on white horses

Not men lacing my drinks

I was so trusting that everyone is essentially good, 

But I can't believe it anymore

Not after that boy who thought "no" meant "yes" and clamored to undress me while I tried to push him away

Not after I woke up to a boy I trusted trying to take my clothes off

Not after a boy pushed me into a room, closed the door, and begged me to get on my knees when I had already told him "no" so many times before 

Not after one of my closest friends punished me for giving other guys attention because he liked me

Not after a boy, who I just thanked, told me "thankfulness doesn't get me a girlfriend"

Not after the boy told me if I didn't have sex with him he would leave 

And another boy who said the same and fulfilled his promise after I said no

Not after the countless guys who lay their hands on me minutes after meeting me

We don't live with white princes

We live in a society that corrupts men into boys

Boys who don't even realize they're doing anything wrong
