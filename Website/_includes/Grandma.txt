Grandma

Karuna Spaulding

Well it’s raining now 

and you’re playing the piano 

you remember the notes

but forgot how they make you feel. 

I can see the back of your head, 

one arm gliding over the keys

the other holding a baby

whose name you can’t

quite recall

Who are you playing to? 

And what confusion 

is painting glass

over you dull eyes? 

The song never ends, 

you forget where you were. 

You forget to end it. 

It’s raining now.
