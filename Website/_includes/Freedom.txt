Freedom

Ariane Petersen

A gentle inhale 

that releases mist

The smell of sweetly 

rotting leaves

is what keeps me walking

down the path turned journey

I’ll make the route 

Once I get there. 

Then others may follow

A hope unspoken, 

that I’ll be of use 

to you, 

unknown stranger

who has taken a path 

made of crushed aspirations, 

I did all this for you

In my next breath

I almost taste the trampled

leaves under foot. 

The sweet taste makes me smile
