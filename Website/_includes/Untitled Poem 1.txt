Considered homeless with nothing to eat

No clothing, no blankets, no shoes for our feet.

Ten wonderful children, oh so sweet,

All our memories I wouldn't delete.

Yet I'm homeless with 10 kids and yet my journey ISN'T complete.

I wish I could provide,

But I have no one by my side.

Just 10 wonderful kids and all I can say is "I tried".

And I can't say I haven't cried,

But I have and it's time to put my pride aside.

Because my time has come too soon and my life is ending,

There's no use pretending,

My kids' hearts are bending,

It's probably too late for mending.

Taking my last breath,

Exhaling life, and inhaling death.

I have let my children down, what a burn out.

But everyone knows I love them no doubt.
