<p class="P4">Izzy Srivastava<a name="_GoBack"></a></p> Izzy Srivastava <a name="_GoBack"></a> Submission 3 <br/> It is very easy to forget <br/> Sitting here, almost midnight, with a calculus final that feels like a guillotine hanging over my head <br/> That I am made of stardust <br/> That I am molecules that have been compressed and superheated and scattered across the ground, <br/> Molecules that have made up much bigger and much smaller things than myself <br/> And that when I am ashes, <br/> I will be ashes that drift to the bottom of the river Ganges, sequester themselves beneath stones in the creek-bed at the Glen, wash up on the beaches of Sydney, sink into the soil of Ontario, <br/> And lend whatever nutrients they have to a small, tenacious plant that will claw free of the dirt <br/>   <br/> It is very easy to forget <br/> That we are all scientific miracles of exactly the right place and exactly the right time <br/> And the person we bump into because we turned the corner too fast is existing in their own intricately woven web of a life, in which we appear as an extra, a background character, when we are the quirky protagonist of our own story <br/>   <br/> It is very easy to forget <br/> That I am a soul hammered into shape by lifetimes <br/> That the quicksand of trivialities does not have to suck the blood from my veins; the blows from Bane’s fists do not have to break my spine <br/> And that I am not alone <br/>   <br/> Oh, I will see you when the stars slide out from behind the clouds <br/> When they wink at me, shining purple and white and blue and green in a midnight sky that swallows them in the next instant <br/> I will see you when rain sparks on the pavement <br/> And soaks through my clothes <br/> And runs down my face in a thousand tiny cold, clean touches <br/> I will hear you when the algorithm throws me a curveball <br/> Chords reverberating through my head as I stand, transfixed <br/> I speak to you at night, in storms, in my head, in my fantasies, <br/> And there are times when I could swear you are standing right next to me <br/> There are times when I take two steps to the left to make room for you <br/> And every now and then a memory of you will swallow me whole, a wave that knocks me under and pins me beneath it, though I am unwilling to struggle <br/> And I will be right there again <br/> Whether it’s running down that quiet hallway <br/> Or grinning at you <br/> Or stealing glances from my cozy corner of a pointless discussion <br/>   <br/> But it is excruciatingly easy to forget <br/>   <br/> You were this star <br/> This quiet, quirky, mortal star that blinked into my sight <br/> But by the time your light reached me, you were almost gone <br/> And you burst <br/> Your light and laughter and writing and memories and funny faces and goofy glances and gentle wisdom and warm heart strewn all across my life <br/> You scattered yourself across an entire universe <br/> My universe <br/> And even though I just have to trust that it was your time— <br/> Even though I find that impossible to hear, impossible to handle— <br/> You left me with the remnants of a supernova <br/> Searing through my life <br/>   <br/> I am a patchwork <br/> Of cold winter nights and hot summer afternoons <br/> Of anger and regret <br/> Of confusion and certainty <br/>   <br/> It is very easy to forget <br/> That I am made of stardust <br/> And the fabric of you <br/>   <br/>
