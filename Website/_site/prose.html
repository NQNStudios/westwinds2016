<div class="work-text">
My limbs are thin and weak but they have fought their wars as the strongest soldier on the battlefield. My forearms and thighs carry reminders of one night stands with razor blades. Our promiscuous evenings together often begin and end with blank stares. There is an abundance of bare skin and deep kisses, but it is not making love, it is more like drunken, meaningless sex. Those affairs are meant to make me feel better, but when it's over I end up alone in my own bed, dressed in sweaters of shame.

My mind is strong and intelligent but it has difficulty producing serotonin and sometimes it goes haywire reminiscing about all the things he's said to me, and once in a while I get a headache trying to discover any hidden messages behind the words that slip out between perfect teeth.

The blood that travels through my veins doesn't circulate well to my hands and feet, but has no trouble rushing to my cheeks when he compliments me, and it seems even more willing to accompany my face after he says, “You're blushing.”

My legs are one of my favorite artifacts in my ever-changing museum of a body. They are long and lean. They wobble when I'm emotionally honest and my thighs don't touch but I cross my cold fingers that nobody takes that gap to mean weakness, because the small muscle surrounding my skeleton could carry me across oceans. These legs don't like to sit still for very long so in order to cope with their unceasing wanting to wander, they constantly bounce, cross, and uncross until they can take me somewhere new.

I adore the way my hands were carved as if out of ivory and I don't mind how they are cold like marble. Maybe it's from scarcity of nutrition or the amplitude of sertraline, but my fists shake like the last leaf in autumn,  But it isn't falling that these fingers are afraid of Their trepidation comes from the possibility of never running through the dark forest of his hair.  Their trepidation comes from the possibility of never running through the dark forest of his hair.

This is my body. My blood is low on iron and my brain is lacking happy chemicals I have scars and sweat glands, guilty pleasures and vices But I have alluring eyes and captivating words behind my gapped teeth  But I have alluring eyes and captivating words behind my gapped teeth  But I have alluring eyes and captivating words behind my gapped teeth  I have an interesting history, unequal parts tragedy and comedy, and a single stretch mark on my left knee that I love. This is body positivity. This is me claiming my most prized possession after a decade of trying to trade it in for a stereotypical mold of a model.

This is freedom.

<div class="work-title">Waiting in Water by Carter Peterson</div>


<div class="work-text">
It felt like an anchor of iron that pulled her down wherever she walked. She was
overwhelmed. She had to read the boring book. Had to write a paper. Had to finish math homework. Had to turn in missing work. Had to do this. Had to do that. There was always something to do. Something that needed to be done. Something that became a monster.

But not here.

The waves seemed endless. Always they washed up the bank, spreading tiny rivers through the grains of dirt. The ever 
flowing water would reach the peak of its momentum, and just for a moment... the wave ceased to be. For those few invisible moments, the water clutched onto the shore, gripping with futile grasp, begging to stay above its own body for just a couple more moments. The pleas.. never heard. The desperate peak fell back into its own depression, moaning in frustration.

She gazed out at the lake. The center of the pool seemed completely still as she looked above the water flowing back and forth over her bare feet. Always moving, but never drifting. She gazed at the center, seeing no disturbance. Still, yet flowing. But even as she looked, she could feel the water rising to her feet, tickling her toes, and sinking into the dirt beneath her. It was an enigma.

The lake was isolated from the world. Ringed by tall trees of ashen leaves, it was a sanctuary of the wild. The bank of the pool was nearly nonexistent, covered in wet, dying underbrush. No sunlight brightened the lake, as the sky has morphed into a flowing ocean of grey clouds. A fog closed in around the basin, isolating all but the first ring of trees from the rest of the world. She was alone.

She felt the water tickle her feet again. The lake was silent.. with only one noise. She did not know what it was, but she knew it came from the lake. She peered deeply into the lake, searching for whatever was calling her. Nothing could be seen but the perfectly still surface. No ripples sent minute waves across the expanse. No underwater creature disturbed its tidal abode. There was nothing to be seen. But it continued to call.

She took one step into the water. Cold, but not freezing. Another step. The sandy dirt underneath erupted around her foot as it pressed into the soft clay. Another. The brisk water rose up to her ankle now. Another. She could feel herself being lowered into the ground. Another. The dirt floor felt like a cushion as it pressed up between her toes. Another. She was to her waist now, feeling the crisp waterline against her skin. She pressed down on her feet, and pushed off onto her belly, floating into the water. She spun around so that her back was submerged, and her face looked up at the misty sky. She heard the call no more.

She drifted for an eternity. She was completely hidden from the world in this lake of solitude. She didn’t have to worry. She didn’t have to think. She didn’t have to feel. Her mind became empty, and she closed her eyes, embracing the utter peace. Drifting in endless tranquility. She was alone. She was calm. She was happy.

...

AIR! She needed air! Her eyes snapped open, stinging as water flowed into them. Air. She saw a hint of light above her. Air. She pumped her arms against the water, kicking her feet valiantly. Air. She felt her lungs empty, and felt her muscles strain as they were denied life. Air! Her lungs demanded her to breathe in, to take in life. Air! She fought them as much as she could. AIR! She could not open her mouth. AIR! The light was closer. AIR! Closer. AIR! CLOSER!

Air. She breathed it into her body, giving herself life as she arched her back, forcing her body to rise above the surface. The air flowed through her, into her lungs, then into each muscle, each organ, each limb, until she was full of it. She kept it inside of her for a moment, scared of letting it go. But her lungs forced it out of her, and she took in another deep breath. In and out. In and out. In and out. Eventually, her breathing became regular.

The lake was alive with sunlight. The water glistened like a field of flowing crystals, and the ripples she had caused washed over them, making waves of diamonds. The ashen trees were lit up by the sun, turned into a bright green shade. The once overcast sky had broken apart to frame a beautiful orb of light as it shone down from the heavens. Her hair was sparkling with water crystals, and her skin was glowing with the warm sunlight. She took in another breath, and smiled.

She was alive.

<div class="work-title">Short Story by Juyoung Kim</div>


<div class="work-text">
It was a land desolated by famine and disease. There was once a time when it was a paradise on Earth. But that was years ago. All that remained were memories of grandeur, of power, of luxury. <br/>
There supposedly was a way to fix this. Every year, a plant called the moonflower would bloom on a certain day. The people of the town boiled it into a tea and everyone over the age of fifteen had to drink it. Then, one person would collapse. He or she would go to the spirit world to try to fix the land’s curse. But no one had succeeded for years. <br/>
And if they did not succeed, they did not come back. <br/>
It would be Seth’s first year drinking the moonflower tea. Yet he was familiar to its power already. It had taken his father away ten years ago. Seth could remember the day clearly: he had come home in the evening and saw his mother alone in the house. “Where’s Dad?” he had said. <br />
His mother turned. “Dad won’t be coming back anymore,” she managed to say before she ended up sobbing in his arms. Something broke in his mother then, and it was all Seth could do to make her happy now. <br/>
Everyone gathered around the town square. The mayor began pouring tea from the large cauldron into cups, and the city council passed them around. Seth could hear his mother praying softly to the gods to protect him. He was all that she had left. <br/>
The cups were all passed out. There was an awkward silence, and it seemed that the entire world had stopped but for the fire that was flickering in the center of the town square. <br/>
“May our savior come forth today,” the mayor said, as he said every year. <br/>
“May our savior come forth today,” said the townspeople, and they all drank. <br/>
Seth sipped the tea. Was it supposed to be this strong and bitter? It ignited all of his taste buds on fire even though it was merely a sip. Then his other senses began to overload: his ears began ringing, his sight flashed black and white, a sickly smell wafted through the air. <br/>
Then everything turned black, and the last thing he remembered was his mother’s screams. <br/>
Seth opened his eyes, and he saw the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. <br/>
Plants of every color surrounded a delicately carved fountain. They bloomed wildly, as if saying, “This is what it is to be free”. The flowers ranged from small to spotted to multicolor, and a pleasant fragrance came from them. He walked over to the fountain and was amazed by the water. In the village, the water would be almost murky, and tasted metallic. But this, this was pure, clear water. What would it taste like? <br/>
“Go ahead and try it,” a voice said from behind him. Seth turned, and he saw a lady emanating a crystal blue aura in a white dress. Her blue eyes and brown hair complemented her fair face. In her right hand she held a wooden staff. <br/>
“Uh, is th-this your fountain?” he stuttered. <br/>
The lady smiled. “Yes; but you can try it,” she replied in a melodious voice. <br/>
He cautiously cupped water in a little gourd by the fountain and drank it. Soon his cup was back in the fountain for more. He had never tasted something as wonderful as this! <br/>
“Wow…” he said, “this is a marvelous place. This is the best tasting water I have ever had! And the plants… Are they all yours?” <br/>
The woman nodded. “Would you like to live here?” she asked. “I know it’s rather abrupt, but…” <br/>
“Absolutely!” Seth answered. He was about to dip his gourd in for some more water, but his mind flashed back to the village. “But…” he started, but the lady interrupted him. <br/>
“I see you have some doubt,” she said. “I can grant you immortality here, Seth. You could live here, in this perfect world, forever, without any worries. You would soon forget your horrible past in the village. And I know you tire of caring for your scarred mother day after day. Would it not be better to stay with me?” <br/>
Seth immediately replied, “No, that’s not true!” but he knew that he was lying. He was at times tired of taking care of his mother, of staying at home when his friends would be hanging out, of being the responsible one in the house. <br/>
The woman smiled again, but this time it seemed scary instead of kind. “I know you are lying, Seth. If you accept my gift, you would never have to see your broken mother again. You would never have to feed her every single meal, you would never have to suffer, to feel pain. You would never have to see her struggle to live every single day; you would never have to sacrifice your precious time for her!” The lady was yelling now, and her face was flushed red. “You would never have to hear HER CRY THE NIGHT AWAY, DO YOU HEAR ME!” <br/>
But Seth did not hear her. He heard his mother, on the day his father left, the day he accepted the lady’s gift. Part of her died that day, and he knew that the other part would die too, if he became immortal. <br/>
“I apologize, but I cannot take your offer,” Seth said. <br/>
“Then die!” the lady screamed, and her face transformed into a mask of swamp green skin. Her eyes became blood red, and her brown hair became jet black. The wooden staff became an obsidian spear. She rushed toward him, and the moment the spear touched him, it felt as if his soul was drained away. <br/> Then he felt nothing else.<br/>
It was dark when he woke up, so Seth could not tell if he was dead or not. However, Seth soon realized that he could move his arms and legs again. “Did I not die?” he thought. His eyes began to focus and he realized that he was in his room in his house, except everything had been taken away. He walked to the window and brushed away the curtains. <br/>
What he saw almost convinced him that he truly was dead. For this was not the village that he had lived in before. Seth saw a crisp blue sky lined with fluffy white clouds and green grass gently swaying from the wind. He saw so many colors and things that were alive in what used to be a barren and desolate field that it seemed impossible. Maybe this was what they called the afterlife. <br/>
But then he heard the door creak open. <br/>
His mother’s eyes were wide open. She tried to speak, but he was already in her arms, just like the day ten years ago, except this time, her tears were not of sorrow but of joy. <br/>
And he knew then that he had made the right choice.

<div class="work-title">Dream by Lina Boyer</div>


<div class="work-text">
In my dream, the sun was rising. <br/>
Orange shards of light rippled over the endless ocean, lighting up the white beach houses on the coast.  A man stared out at the water and the sun, the steam from his coffee swirling into the salty air.  Below him, his submarine sat docked, bobbing in the water like a giant rubber marshmallow with a glass window.  After the scalding coffee was all drunk up, he would wake his family so they could take a trip across the sea to the harbour on the other side. <br/>
Behind him a boy tiptoed up the paint-peeled steps, and paused at the top, surprised to see a grown man as awe-struck by the glimmering expanse of water as he was. <br/>
The boy had shaggy hair that dipped down over his eyes and covered up his ears.  Ruffled pajamas hung in wrinkles around his bony limbs.  The boy was not the man’s son.  Or neighbor.  Or nephew.  He hardly knew the man.  He was the forgotten stepson of a friend of a friend of a friend to the man, but he had no where else to live and I can’t remember why, but this man took him in.   <br/>
The boy didn’t know whether or not to climb down again.  The sky and the sun stretched across the horizon so wonderfully, but that man was a stranger he’d prefer not to talk to.  In the end it was too late.  Those last sips of black coffee were gone and the dawn was creeping into morning.  The man saw the boy before he had the chance to run away, and told him gently to wake the others. <br/>
The others, the mother, the son, and the daughter, were nearly completely ready by the time the whole sky had faded from pink to blue.  The mother stood by the dock with a picnic basket clutched in her hand,  shouting after her children and the boy to hurry up, and that they were wasting the time they had planned to relax on a different shore of the same ocean.   <br/>
When the man could finally untie the frail ropes from the rubber submarine and let his family drift away from shore, the sun was casting shorter shadows and the sky was a fuller blue. But when the man jumped in the U-boat, he pulled a lever and shut out the horizon.  The boy and the family were pressed together around a cold metal handrail, just making out the silhouettes of each other’s faces by the dying light bulbs fixed to the rubber walls around them.  The mother pressed down some buttons and the boy squoze the handrail as tightly as he could.  The son and the daughter laughed at him for being so nervous.  Suddenly, the submarine whirred and then began dropping downwards, meter by meter, and his taunters became silent.  The boy peered out the little glass window, but all he could see was a dark blue, slowly growing darker.  In their little tank the family propelled themselves down to depths of the sea, and then floated across towards the harbour on the other side.  The boy began to relax his grip when a jolt knocked him into the mother.  The U-boat groaned, and then was silent.  The family didn’t make a sound, either.  Then, a few moments later, it creaked and dropped several meters.  The daughter began to whimper, and the mother shushed her.  The man imagined, for a split second, the seams holding vehicle together breaking apart, and ejecting his family and the little boy into the icy water.  And he imagined the endless blue ocean, and the giant creatures, and the miles it was to the surface.  He pulled himself out of the trance and pushed on all the levers and pressed all the buttons, even though somewhere in the back of his mind he realised that it wouldn’t do anything.  There was too much pressure all around them.  The flashing lights went dim and the dying bulbs went black.  Above them, the edges of the submarine were ripping.  In a split second the man reached up for the dangling rope attached to the ceiling and his son grabbed his other hand.  Then the ocean came flooding in, and then there were no more walls, and the metal handrail dropped away, but the air that was left in the rubber tarp that had once been the roof shot up towards the surface.  The man was pulled up behind it, grasping after the fraying rope, and behind him he pulled his family, connected by a chain of hands.  All around them, endless blue water flowed past them and became slowly lighter.  Somewhere far above the man could see the shifting light from the surface, but three people below him, the boy could only feel the dark salt water bubble up around his body.  And to the side of all of them the sea stretched on, seemingly forever, with no hint of the harbour on the other side. <br/>
And that’s when I woke up.  I will never know if they broke the surface, or if they sank and drowned.

<div class="work-title">The Lion Man by Lina Boyer</div>


<div class="work-text">
Delilah wore a yellow dress the day the storm came, because the news promised sunshine and her mother said she looked so lovely in it. But maybe that day the news was wrong. Before they had time to leave the house, rain was dripping from the cracks in the roof and salty air was blowing up beneath the floorboards. In an hour, the wind had grown louder and rocked their tiny hut from side to side, ripping off some of the roof panels and exposing Delilah to the cloudy sky. Her Momma tuned the old radio to any station that still worked while Delilah peered through the rips in her home at the river that flowed through the middle of her street, a river that had never been there before. It was a wonderful thing to see, until a man came flowing with it, screaming for help, and her Momma ran out into the storm to save him. <br/> 
“Momma!” Delilah had yelled from the door of their house. <br/> 
“Stay there!” Her Momma had time to reply, before the current caught her off balance and pulled her down the flooded street. Delilah had stood there, frozen with shock, until the wind blew apart her house and she was forced to run, her little sundress flying out behind her, away from the water and wind. <br/> 
When the clouds moved on and her beach-side city lay on the ground, silent and broken, her Momma still had not come home. People were lying in the street, beside the skeletons of homes and automobiles. They had cried for water and medications. They had cried so loudly that their cacophony stole Delilah’s chance at being heard.<br/>
Now Delilah wandered the ruins where her street had been, hoping that maybe her mother would think to go back to where her home once stood. A few of their neighbors searched through the debris left over from the river. A woman picked up silver coins and broken television apparatuses, not because they were hers, but because she was hoping to earn something from the disaster. Delilah crept behind her and pulled tentatively on the woman’s sleeve. The woman spun around and glared at her, pulling her trophies away from the little girl. <br/>
“What?” <br/>
Delilah pointed down the street, the way the river had flowed. “My Momma went down there.” <br/> 
The woman pushed her away.  <br/>
“Have you seen her? I don’t know where my Momma-” <br/> 
“She’s dead, child! Who could survive that? Now move! I can’t help you!” <br/>
Delilah dropped her gaze and felt tears well up in her eyes. If she wasn’t so scared she would be completely numb inside. Somewhere from behind her a deep voice reprimanded the woman for being so heartless. But it didn’t help Delilah. Slowly she sank to the dirty ground, hugging her legs and breathing into her knees.  <br/> 
She was startled by a rough hand rest on her shoulder, The same deep voice said, “What did she look like?” A man with bulging muscles and terrible scars looked straight at her. He had a mane of hair like a lion, and eyes as dark and arms as strong as one, too. Delilah wiped her runny nose and mumbled her mother’s description, so quiet that the lion-like man could barely understand her. But somehow, he must have, because his eyes lit up, “I met a woman with a broken leg, who had a daughter with a yellow dress. I can take you there.” Many people would be frightened of the man who had the face of a lion, but not the girl in the yellow dress. She took his hand and they began walking. <br/> 
People stared when a man as tall as The Lion Man led a girl through the broken city. The sun bounced waves of heat from the road to the sky and back again. The streets were mostly empty and stretched on forever. When Delilah could hardly take a step further, The Lion Man told her a story, about a boy who wanted to catch the sunset, so he walked towards the horizon until he became so tired he slept for thousands of years. <br/>
“But your mother is not a sunset.” he pointed out. “We’ll catch her soon.” Delilah nodded slowly, vaguely aware of police sirens screaming in the distance. The Lion Man looked up suddenly. His eyes darted towards the noise and clutched Delilah's hand by his side. Then the sirens faded and he relaxed his grip. Delilah looked at him curiously, but said nothing, and neither did The Lion, so they continued to walk.  <br/> 
By early evening they reached the encampment where her Momma should have been. But every tent they checked was filled to maximum capacity, but none of those people were her. At the end of a long row of canvas homes, Delilah sat and looked on as The Lion Man continued to search. Delilah could never believe that The Lion Man had tricked her, she was too innocent, but even she had painful doubts that her Momma had never been there at all. An old, wrinkled woman laying beside Delilah in the tent next door suddenly sat up and took Delilah’s dress in her hands. <br/> “Your Mother is looking for you.” The old woman smiled and then lay down again to rest. The Lion Man, hearing the woman, lumbered over and shook her awake. <br/> 
“Where is she, old woman?” <br/> 
The woman scratched her lip and looked towards the sky.  <br/>
“In a tavern. The one that the water didn’t touch.” She lay down again. Before they could leave, she sat up one more time and put a hand on The Lion Man’s shoulder. <br/>
“I recognize you.” Her eyes narrowed. “From a poster or a sign-” The Lion Man brushed off her hand and pulled Delilah out of the tent. Delilah looked back at the woman, who was now waking another woman, and pointing towards the giant man.  <br/> 
They ran. The Lion said that they ran because the tavern would soon close, and of course Delilah believed him. The tavern was lit and people looked like they were only just beginning to come, but The Lion Man pushed past them to the front desk. Frantically, he asked for the woman with the broken leg, but she had already left, said the man at the desk. She had gone to her sister’s home, where they had an automobile and could drive her home again.” <br/> 
The Lion Man’s lion face fell and he placed his arm around Delilah. <br/> 
“We’ll find her.” he said, and Delilah was sure of it, too. They stepped aside to let another man through, just as the doors to the tavern burst open. Men in uniforms entered, ordering everyone to stand still. The Lion Man yanked Delilah behind a cluster of overly merry people, and dropped to his hands and knees. A few paces away, he opened a trap door and dropped down below. Delilah leaned over the edge. <br/> 
“What are you doing?” She whispered. <br/>
“Hiding.” He held out his arms. She jumped into them and The Lion pulled the two of them deeper into the basement. They sat behind barrels of beer and waited in silence. Chill air prickled Delilah’s skin and made her shiver so that The Lion Man pulled her close to his warmth. The basement was too dark for her, and the thumping of boots above to loud. <br/> 
“Who are we hiding from?” Delilah whispered. The Lion squeezed her shoulders.  <br/>
“The police.” He rumbled.  <br/>
Delilah pulled away from her giant friend. What could they possibly want from a man like him? Spears of light from the room above fell over The Lion. His eyes were cast down to the floor and his lip quivered slightly. “I escaped from the prison when the storm came. The first time I’ve been outside-out here- in years.” <br/> Delilah looked over at him in shock. “Why were you with them?” <br/> 
Although she asked only a simple question and said nothing too sad, small silver teardrops slipped out from the eyes of The Lion. <br/> 
“I did something, Delilah. Something very bad.” <br/>
They sat together in silence until the noise from above slowly quieted. “I need to help you.” He went on. “It may be the last thing I’ll ever do.” <br/>
But Delilah, lulled by the warmth from her Lion and dead tired down to the bone, drifted to sleep before she could understand what he said. She dreamt that she was the boy who chased the sunset, but something was chasing her as well. She woke before dawn with a cold feeling she understood what the dream meant. But then The Lion Man woke too and she forgot.  <br/> 
They stood and tip toed to trap door. The Lion Man pushed it open to a dark and empty tavern, and they snuck out with the rising sun. <br/>
Delilah’s aunt lived outside of the city, many miles away, so they walked from the early morning into the afternoon, on dirt roads with not a tree for shade. They walked until the sun dipped down to the horizon again, but by now Delilah sat on The Lion’s shoulders, watching for her aunt’s familiar farm, and secretly keeping an eye out for the flashing sirens. No matter what The Lion Man did, he couldn't go to a prison. Delilah decided that when they began walking that day. <br/> 
By nightfall they had come to the town her Momma was in. Flickering streetlights illuminated the way down the street, and far away, some cars drove across the street. Cicadas chirped, making music for the stars you could see so well. Her aunts has was coming up. It was a few blocks away when the sirens started blaring. Delilah turned to her friend. His eyes were panicked. Holding her hand, he started to run. The sirens circled around them, growing louder and then tapering off only to come by again. But they ran straight. They ran so fast the stars above Delilah seemed to swirl, and the ground beneath her feet disappeared from underneath her. The streetlamp flicked off and behind her, Delilah could see the blue and red lights flashing closer and closer. The Lion Man could run faster and pulled her up the porch steps to her aunts ricketty farm house. As soon as he banged his fist against the door, his strangled expression seemed to relax. The terror in his eyes was not gone, but he was calmer, even though the cars were a block away. <br/>
“Hide!” Delilah hissed. “Why don’t you hide? Like you did in the tavern?” Suddenly her aunt opened the door. Her aunt had an obvious look of relief on her face, but glanced at The Lion Man and the police arriving behind him with concern. <br/>
“Delilah! Come in! Your mother is here-” The Lion Man breathed out with relief. The sirens stopped and the cars parked outside of her aunts house. The Lion Man smiled at Delilah as the men in the uniforms came up behind him. Finally, Delilah understood what was going on. Before the men could reach her friend, she reached for him but realised she never learned his name. <br/>
“Lion…”she could only think to say, before he turned around and walked to the men in uniform. But before he sat in the car, he turned around and smiled. <br/> 
“Thank you,” he said.

<div class="work-title">Princess by Scout Asay</div>


<div class="work-text">
Princess was my best friend in the whole world—she was any eight-year-old’s dream doll, tall, golden, and plastic. Her blue eyes sparkled, and she looked like her namesake in whatever I dressed her in. She had everything she could ever want, whenever she wanted it. My brown eyes gazed lovingly into her blue ones as I held her smooth hand in my rough one. She was a princess—my Princess. It was little matter to me that her smile never changed. <br/><br/> Mama never thought Princess a dream, and she told Daddy that, often enough that he had an automatic response for her complaints. “She’s only eight, you’re making a fuss of nothing.” Mama would then point out that it had been four years of Princess-topia, and Daddy would brush this off. “She’ll grow out of it. All kids do.” <br/><br/> I never understood Mama’s dislike of Princess. Princess was pretty; didn’t everyone like pretty? I wanted to be just like Princess. I dressed up in Mama’s clothes because they looked more like Princess’s clothes than mine. I pulled out Mama’s lipsticks and smothered my lips in sticky pink glosses until they shone like Princess’s fuchsia ones. I never did it while Mama was home. She would have been angry. I was too young for such things, she would say as she shook her finger. “Go play with Ruthie and Abigail, you spend too much time inside with Princess. It’s nice out, and you need the sunshine. It’s healthy. It’s the loveliest day, and you are the loveliest girl.” She wasn’t right, though, as anyone could see: Princess was the loveliest girl, and every minute with her was like a dream. <br/><br/> I didn’t play with Princess and her fantasyland much after the seventh grade, because at thirteen, I determined dolls were for children, and I was obviously not a child. What a silly, droll pastime! This made Papa smug, and I once overheard him remark to Mama, “See, I told you she’d grow out of it. All kids do.” Mama confused me by responding, “We’ll see.” She still seemed worried. <br/><br/> Three years went by without me ever picking up Princess, but I kept her, just because she was “a relic of juvenile fantasy”, as I so often told my friends when they mentioned Princess’s presence above my mirror. I was an adult, nearly. I had other things to worry about. Still, I was always aware of Princess’s position above my head as I wrestled with my too-tight jeans and struggled to smooth my blemished skin with concealer. She looked down on me whenever I stood before the mirror, and I imagined her to be amused, in much the same way I was when I watched my three-year-old cousin try to do her hair like mine, or talk like me, or gesture the same way. Always a silly imitation, silly in its vainness. <br/><br/> In this way, Princess was very present in my life, even though I never touched her. I didn’t dare move her. Twice while cleaning out my room I thought about giving Princess a new home, or just throwing her away, but I could never bring myself to do it. She had been a fixture of my childhood--how could I toss that? And so Princess stayed, perched daintily upon my mirror, surveying my every move with her sparkling blue eyes, and forever smiling her fuschia smile. <br/><br/> At sixteen, I began to worry. Princess had started to follow me. Not actually, of course, but I found that whenever I stood before a mirror, I felt her pretty blue eyes burning holes into my head, as if she sat upon every mirror everywhere. Those blue eyes obliterated any semblance of value I had. I’d begin to feel sick. I cried more. Then Princess was everywhere I saw a reflection of myself: the rearview mirror, Ms. Dubinski’s east-facing windows, the polished floors of my mother’s office, Miranda’s glasses, trendy storefronts, the dentist’s aquarium. Wherever my face was, Princess’s was there, too. I felt I was unraveling, slowly and painfully, and that Princess was on the other end of the thread. She wasn’t going to let go. <br/><br/> So I painted my face, and didn’t eat, and ran until my blisters popped and I doubled over, choking out vomit. None of it stopped or even slowed her progress, as her pale, painted hands pulled at the fibers of my being. If anything, she seemed to be gathering speed. It terrified me. I tried to reason. I was a person, and she was manufactured. But she was perfect, and I cried. <br/><br/> Under Princess’s power, I finished the last day of the school year and collected my yearbook. I eagerly signed all the yearbooks people handed to me, and gleefully read what they wrote in return. The pages were crammed with messages in every color. “You are such a queen, guuuuurrrl!!! See you this summer!!!” “You, me, and every beautiful thing, girlfriend!” “HMU 4 movie marathons this summer! We have a lot to catch up on!” Ambiguous Office quotes. Ice cream. Friends. <br/><br/> When I returned home late that night, after hours of swimming and bicycle stunts and DIY piercings, I was exhausted. As I entered my room, I looked up at Princess, posed over the mirror. And then—what was that noise? Growling? It stopped; it started. I looked in the mirror. It was I. I had growled at Princess, like a dog at a wolf. I had bared my teeth—my teeth that were not like Princess’s, despite three years of braces. My eyes had narrowed—my brown, brown eyes that mandated contacts, nothing like Princess’s clear, sparkling blue ones! “Where is my sparkle? Ha--glitter eyes,” I thought, as I slid onto my bed and opened my yearbook. I slid my fingers across the pages, and flipped to my portrait. I was pretty. I was nice. I was good. I was enough. Yes, yes, yes— <br/><br/> No—no words could describe my horror, for there, on the shiny page, was Princess’s face where mine ought to have been. It was a fresh testament to her supremacy. How she haunted me, haunted me! Blue eyes, sparkling eyes, eyes that I had begged often enough to snap my spine, instead of testing its strength. How I hated her, hated her, with all my heart and mind! I leapt from the bed and swept Princess from her pedestal. In my frenzy, I took hold of her wavy blonde locks and beat her body against the wall. I melted her hands with matches. I stabbed her stomach with needles. I slashed her hair off and flushed it down the toilet. I heaved her head from her body, demented by my seizure of power. I was so angry, so very angry, at what she had done to me. It wasn’t fair! And still, still her eyes followed me. The blue, blue eyes! They taunted me, mocked me! Jezebel, Delilah! A thousand shots of humiliation! I sliced her face in two, and tore the head. I stabbed and stabbed and stabbed the remnants, until the eyes were shreds, ever lapping up my pain. Then I lit the tatters, and observed as Princess’s eyes were liquefied into puddles.

<div class="work-title">The Scream&#58; Based on a True Story by Shalom Andra</div>


<div class="work-text">
A year before my birth, a small gathering was held in the backwoods of Missouri. In the late summer, hot days fade to hot nights. This night, however, a light breeze (which was a rare thing indeed) calmed the group sitting on the porch. The crickets sang back and forth in mating rituals, and frogs living in a pond close by croaked. The only sound they made was from Papa, telling a story as if they were in the other room. It became obvious to my dad (who is slow to understand anyone) where my mother got her ostentatious laugh and booming smile, both of which I, too, would inherit. <br/><br/>Uncle felt jealousy that he would contain for the rest of his life. As his papa leaned foreword, telling my mother the story, it became painfully obvious who the favorite will always be. He gnaws anxiously at his fingers, another thing I will inherit eventually. My uncle watched a large toad the size of his small hand hop onto the porch. He was the only one to notice; everyone else sat rigidly, watching Papa as his story reached the climax. <br/><br/>As Papa tells the story, he looks at her daughter, a beautiful woman of seventeen, soon to be engaged, and sees himself. Her eyes were lit the same way he knew his were. Her smile is wide, and seems to swallow her face, like he felt on his mouth. Papa trailed off at the best part of the story-something that my mom learned to do. <br/><br/>Mom looks at him with irritation and admiration. She urges his with impatience, a fault she will carry on for the rest of her life. Mom looks at her papa’s coffee-stained teeth, and loud brown eyes. She forgives him, in this moment, for abandoning her as a child. In this moment, she only cares about what could possibly come next in the story, that she already knew was more lie than truth. <br/><br/>A scream comes from the woods, and everyone is silent. Uncle drops his friend. Mom stands up. Papa forgets the story. As Mom and Papa run, my uncle grabs the flashlight on the table, and runs after them. They don’t speak. The laughter, the jealousy, and the forgiveness are all replaced by terror. <br/><br/> Mom prays: “Let us find this woman.” <br/><br/> Uncle prays: “Let me find this woman.” <br/><br/> Papa prays: “Let this woman be safe.” <br/><br/>In the first hour of searching, they didn’t call out; the fear struck down all sound. And it wasn’t the three humans in the dark wood either; the animals listened and searched for the woman, too, in their own way. <br/><br/>By the second hour, the fear was replaced with desperation. They called out for someone, though they didn’t know who. They called out for someone, though they didn’t know where. <br/><br/>In the third hour of searching, their desperation faded into determination. Their voices were hoarse, but they continued to call louder. They were screaming. <br/><br/>By the fourth hour of searching, their actions were routine. They’d forgotten the fear they felt when they heard the scream. Their voices whispers. They just walked, shined the flashlight around, moved on. <br/><br/>They walk to the small cabin, which illuminates a small clearing in the trees. Their disappointment is so strong that it takes the form of exhaustion. They each go to bed without conversation. <br/><br/>Before they fall asleep they think. <br/><br/> Mom curses: “Why couldn’t we find that poor woman?” <br/><br/> Uncle curses: “Why couldn’t we find that sad woman?” <br/><br/> Papa curses: “What was wrong with that woman?” <br/><br/>  They were wrong in their assumption of the sound coming from a woman. It wasn’t until the next morning that they realized their mistake. Puma tracks circled the cabin. The animal even went as far as to walk up to the kitchen window. <br/><br/> Each in turn expressed gratitude for an unsuccessful hunt.
