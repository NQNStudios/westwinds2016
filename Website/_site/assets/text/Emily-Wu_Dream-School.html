I dream of a place that only exists in our minds, <br/>         Where our mission is to absorb and find <br/>         Knowledge not native to our brains. <br/>         I dream of a place where students aren’t laborers , <br/>         Where they don’t have to struggle to make ends meet, <br/>         Where learning doesn’t feel like torture, <br/>         And grades aren’t a death sentence. <br/>         I dream of a place where everything is offered, <br/>         And we can learn what we choose, <br/>         When we choose. <br/>         I dream of a place where finals week isn’t like <br/>         A giant guillotine hanging over our necks. <br/>         I dream of a place where students don’t have to stay up, <br/>         Crying in the middle of the night, <br/>         When it’s far, far too late to go to bed, <br/>         Far, far too late to function properly, <br/>         Trying to finish a mountain of homework that’s all due the next day. <br/>         I dream of a place, where high school doesn’t have to be <br/>         A balanced pyramid of grades, sleep and social life <br/> <p class="Standard">        And you can only pick two. <a name="_GoBack"></a></p>         And you can only pick two. <a name="_GoBack"></a>         I dream of a place where students don’t have to be anxious <br/>         Or feel worthless <br/>         Or scared <br/>         Or panicked <br/>         Because of a grade. <br/>         I want learning to be a pleasure. <br/>         Not a pain. <br/>         <br/>   <br/>
