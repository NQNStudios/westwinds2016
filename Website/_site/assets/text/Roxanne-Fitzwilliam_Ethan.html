You died, <br/> And I apologize, <br/> Because my first thought was of your suicide. <br/> It jumps to my mind instantly when hearing of the death of a teen, <br/> But I'm so very sorry, <br/> Because it wasn't fair of me to distrust you. <br/> I made it up, I hope, <br/> When I stared into the mirror, <br/> Into my eyes, <br/> And saw the tears pooling. <br/> I wore black the next day. <br/> Â  <br/> My sister knew you better than I did. <br/> She even had a crush on you once; <br/> Remember that? <br/> I never saw her cry, <br/> But I know she did, <br/> Because she asked me the next day <br/> Which song I would listen to before my imminent death. <br/> And I told her Satellite, <br/> Satellite because it takes me home <br/> And puts me in orbit around everything I love, <br/> Invisible, but always there. <br/>
