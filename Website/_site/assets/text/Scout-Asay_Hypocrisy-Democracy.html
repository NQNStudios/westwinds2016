I wanna hail the flag at the twilight's last gleaming, <br/> No arms twisted, but proudly beaming <br/> I’ll fight for America ‘til I lie in my grave <br/> Land of the free, home of the brave <br/>   <br/> Because we got problems, yes we do, <br/> They start with education, and learning, too <br/> These boys and girls are taught science and math <br/> But mistakes ain’t growth, they’re a permanent F <br/>   <br/> “Jada pose” “She was asking for it” <br/> How can there be questions about this? <br/> Why aren’t we teaching that no means no? <br/> Rape is rape, you should fucking know <br/>   <br/> Concealed and open-carry, <br/> But two women can’t marry <br/> Founding Fathers never imagined states <br/> With such high suicide rates <br/>   <br/> The big men say they care, but just look at what’s legal: <br/> Corporations are people under our eagle <br/> Rich white don’t get vaccinated, <br/> Wage gaps are debated <br/> Like there’s even a question about disparity-- <br/> Is human love really such a rarity? <br/>   <br/> This is fascist racing fascist, <br/> “Blast them before they blast us!” <br/> Start a war offshore, <br/> Like it ain’t slaughter, but a chore <br/> And back home we got Ferguson and Garner, <br/> People, do you hear? Don your armor! <br/> This means war! There is sin in lukewarm! <br/> People are dying, ‘cause we ain’t even trying! <br/>   <br/> It’s a hot January, here in the States <br/> “Bravery” means “invasion” and “belief” means “hate” <br/> Christians don’t ask what Jesus would do, <br/> Islamophobes are tearing at freedom’s glue <br/> No longer can I stand this hypocrisy <br/> Ain’t this supposed to be a democracy?
