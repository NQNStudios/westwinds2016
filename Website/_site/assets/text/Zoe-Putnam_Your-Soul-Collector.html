Come in, come in, you’re welcome to look <br/> And wander and roam through my store <br/> Of magic and oddities and secrets mistook <br/> And gadgets and gismos of long forgot lore <br/> I am a collector of all things unique <br/> Of unreadable books and an unsayable word <br/> Of people and places and the resident freak <br/> My only retainer is that it’s absurd <br/> So if you are one of society’s senile spoils <br/> Come to me; flock to me where crazy meets real <br/> And bring with you the ends of your long laughed at toils <br/> Come to my collecting counter to heal <br/> I take not your cash, but your long brokered thought <br/> And we’ll barter a price—a toll <br/> I’ll package your hopes, and dreams worthlessly sought <br/> But please, let me gather your soul
