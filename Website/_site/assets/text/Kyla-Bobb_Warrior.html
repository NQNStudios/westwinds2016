You are a warrior <br/> You have endured long, hiked mountains and coulees, <br/> Scored rocky ravines and thorn ridden fields <br/>   <br/> You are a shining example of suffering <br/> And of fighting to the death, <br/> Without actually surrendering your life <br/>   <br/> You erected walls around your torn heart, <br/> Fearful of the pain that could be, <br/> The pain that was <br/>   <br/> Your trust was severed by those that should <br/> Have held that trust. Your bruises <br/> Sunk deep within and penetrated your soul <br/>   <br/> You had experienced love as violence, as hurt, <br/> Physical hurt. But worst of all, <br/> You experienced Emotional hurt <br/>   <br/> Your sweet, innocent, young soul was shattered, broken <br/> And bloodied, and it thought that was <br/> The way life had to be <br/>   <br/> But... <br/>   <br/> You let me in. You trusted me with your battered <br/> Heart. Me, of all others. You gave me the <br/> Privilege to love you, to soothe your anguished soul <br/>   <br/> You allowed me to touch your skin, to feel <br/> Those places that others have damaged <br/> In past encounters <br/>   <br/> You kept me despite all my flaws <br/> Undeterred by any and all <br/> Pain I've caused you in the past <br/>   <br/> You allowed another ruptured soul <br/> To learn from you, to love you to <br/> Make mistakes with you <br/>   <br/> And... <br/>   <br/> I am so very grateful <br/> I, a non-deserving being, receiving the sweet <br/> Love that you bequeath to me <br/>
