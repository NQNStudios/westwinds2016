My brother smokes, <br/> My mother smoked.  <br/> And my dad once thought about it.  <br/>   <br/> But he stopped himself, <br/> For he knew himself, <br/> And that he wouldn't want to live without it. <br/>   <br/> My brother drinks, <br/> My father drinks,  <br/> And my mom once thought about it.  <br/>   <br/> But she stopped herself, <br/> for she knew herself, <br/> And that she wouldn't want to live without it.  <br/>   <br/> So my brother drinks coffee  <br/> And my mother Diet Coke.  <br/> My father drinks coffee,  <br/> Where I feel I'm about to choke. <br/>   <br/> I have never smoked a cigarette,  <br/> nor merely sipped a beer. <br/> The fact of the matter is, I'm completely enveloped in fear. <br/>   <br/> I know you like to smoke, <br/> And I know you like to drink.  <br/> Because all of it sounds like fun.  <br/>   <br/> There's just such a deep history <br/> Of substance dependancy. <br/> And I don't know which way to run. <br/>   <br/>
