In my garden, there is a lemon tree. <br/> The trunk is sleek and sturdy, <br/> And the leaves float like puffs of clouds. <br/> The fruit is sweet as candy, <br/> And sour as is sweet. <br/> In the perfect shape a lemon should be, <br/> Round and twisted at the edges. <br/>   <br/> And the warmth of the spring, <br/> And the rain of the spring, <br/> Brought only more to the garden, <br/> Sunflowers bloomed across the lawn, <br/> Moving to follow the ball of light, <br/> Sunny petals moving in and out, <br/> And sturdy green stems rolling. <br/>   <br/> Soon grape vines wrap the fence, <br/> Twisting through the fence’s holds, <br/> The green offset by speckles of purple, <br/> Adding layers of beauty to the previous garden, <br/> That could warm anyone’s heart. <br/>   <br/> And the frosting on the cake was nothing but perfect, <br/> As strawberry bushes took their corners, <br/> Like holiday lights strung with joy, <br/> The itself was juicy and sweet. <br/>   <br/> And a plant, dense and efficient <br/> Began to grow, <br/> A dandelion of sorts, <br/> But I, with my naïve nature, thought <br/> Weeds are flowers too, <br/> And the next day, when I went outside, <br/> Two dandelions had taken its place. <br/> <p class="P1"><a name="_GoBack"></a></p> <a name="_GoBack"></a> The dandelions roared, swarming the garden, <br/> The strawberries no longer tasted sweet, <br/> They were hard and dry inside, <br/> The carnations withered and died, <br/> Their petals shriveled and turned like rust, <br/> The grape vines thinned like on undernourished, <br/> And the grapes shrunk until nonexistence, <br/> And the sunflowers closed, never to open again, <br/> Saying goodbye to the sun. <br/>   <br/> There was nothing left, <br/> Other than me, <br/> And, of course, my trusty lemon tree. <br/>
