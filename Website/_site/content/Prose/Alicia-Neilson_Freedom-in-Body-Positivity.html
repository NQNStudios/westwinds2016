There is an abundance of bare skin and deep kisses, but it is not making love, it is more like drunken, meaningless sex. Those affairs are meant to make me feel better, but when it's over I end up alone in my own bed, dressed in sweaters of shame.</span></p> <span> My limbs are thin and weak but they have fought their wars as the strongest soldier on the battlefield.
