<p class="P1">“Trust<a name="_GoBack"></a></p> “Trust <a name="_GoBack"></a> By Sophie Valdez <br/>   <br/> Trust isn’t something given away for free, <br/> It should be earned, but I made the mistake. <br/> I trusted to fast and far too easily, <br/> And what did I get?  I got quite the pain. <br/>   <br/> And of course they lied, <br/> And they took my trust, <br/> And they tried to cry, <br/> But turned it to dust. <br/>   <br/> So their cries aren’t heard, <br/> Not registered and I’m free. <br/> I don’t need someone so sure <br/> They know what’s best for me. <br/>   <br/> So my sharp words, <br/> May they cut like a knife, <br/> To make them hurt <br/> Like I did that fateful night <br/>
