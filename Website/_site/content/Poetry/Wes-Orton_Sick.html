Wes Orton <br/> Sick <br/> Â  <br/> I sit in my room, <br/> Or shall I say my prison cell? <br/> With every cough, the agitation of my throat stirs a resting beast within my larynx. <br/> My long forsaken sinuses prevent any semblance of sensory stimulation or pleasure in food, the one thing of which a teenage boy should never be able to get enough. <br/> Cold medicine flows into my system like a waterfall of over-the-counter wishes and dreams, and yet no relief has been achieved. <br/> I beg, please, God, or whatever otherworldly fatewright looks down on me today, let this end! <br/> And yet, here I lie, feverish, unhappy and alone, <br/> Sick. <br/>
