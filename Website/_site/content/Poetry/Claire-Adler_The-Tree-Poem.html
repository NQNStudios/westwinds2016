Claire Adler <br/> The Tree Poem <br/>   <br/> Scientists estimate that the oldest Bristlecone Pine lived over 5000 years <br/> However, despite intensive study, they had still failed to determine if it possessed a heart <br/>   <br/> 5000 years of births and deaths, of hopes and dreams and fallen empires <br/> But before all of them, a seed fell <br/> 3000 years before the birth of Rome, a wind gust <br/> Caused, the scientists say, by a sudden change in air pressure <br/> Thoughtlessly knocked a fruit of shocking insignificance <br/> Onto parched desert earth <br/>   <br/> While mankind etched the first written words into clay by the banks of the Euphrates <br/> The seed, through a fortunate sequence of meteorological occurrences, sprouted in a singularly anticlimactic birth <br/> And began an unassuming journey towards the stars <br/> Iron swords clashed in the Far East, red blood stained the sands of Palestine <br/> <p class="Standard"><span> A new empire took rook in southern Italy</span></p> <span> A new empire took rook in southern Italy</span>  A new empire took rook in southern Italy And far away, due to what scientists say must have been a remarkably wet year, <br/> The tree grew 3 inches <br/>   <br/> New cities rose from the earth, fed by the shriveled souls of men hungry for profit <br/> London, Paris, Barcelona <br/> Steeped in importance, their names cast a spell when uttered aloud <br/> <p class="Standard"><span> On another continent, the tree dropped a branch, likely due to an early snow</span></p> <span> On another continent, the tree dropped a branch, likely due to an early snow</span>  On another continent, the tree dropped a branch, likely due to an early snow In London, a playwright told the story of a mad king <br/> A prince rode to reclaim the promised land <br/> The tree survived a fire, which the scientists assure us was caused by a lightning strike of fascinating intensity <br/>   <br/> The great empires of Europe fought for ownership of a new world <br/> Then, through both the hard work of honest men and effective budgeting <br/> Built new cities hailed as both innovative and efficient <br/> <p class="Standard"><span> New York and Boston</span></p> <span> New York and Boston</span>  New York and Boston The tree struggled forward <br/> Did it feel old? <br/>   <br/> In 1964, a Bristlecone Pine was cut down by scientists for “research purposes” <br/> Only after the stump was examined did they come to the startling conclusion that the tree had been over 500 years old <br/> The accident was deemed regrettable <br/>
