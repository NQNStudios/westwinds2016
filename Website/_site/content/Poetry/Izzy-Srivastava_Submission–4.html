<p class="P4">Izzy Srivastava<a name="_GoBack"></a></p> Izzy Srivastava <a name="_GoBack"></a> Submission 4 <br/> It’s winter <br/> We’re making our way up a long, winding street, pinned to the edge of thriving thoroughfare <br/> Clad in our school uniforms <br/> I’m wearing a bulky red sweater, a long plaid skirt, and tights <br/> You shoot by in your scarlet car <br/> And shout and whistle at me <br/> Because my attempts to walk to my home and have a conversation with a member of my family <br/> Are obviously a desperate cry for you to notice me   <br/> How else will my self-esteem survive? <br/> You haven’t reduced me to nothing more than an object that walks, talks, and exists for your enjoyment <br/> Why did you drive away? <br/> I can wait to jump into your car and ride away with you <br/> I was thirteen <br/>   <br/> It’s spring <br/> I’m in New Zealand, exploring the sights with three generations of my family <br/> I’m walking down the street <br/> I’m wearing jeans and a hoodie <br/> I graze your arm with mine, mutter an apology, keep walking <br/> And so do you <br/> You follow me step for step <br/> And your muttering has gotten louder <br/> Loud enough that I can hear what you’re saying to me <br/> You are threatening me, scaring me, chasing me <br/> And I am in full flight <br/> For anywhere public, anywhere I might be safe <br/> And even after I’ve gotten away from you <br/> I still can’t remember how to breathe <br/> I was thirteen <br/>   <br/> It’s spring <br/> I’m back in school, hitching the train to and fro, often on my own <br/> I’m wearing a billowing button-up and a long plaid skirt <br/> And what do you know? <br/> There you are <br/> Demanding to know about my life <br/> How old? What school? Your name? Getting off here? Live nearby? <br/> You stand too close, you smile with cold eyes, you won’t step away from me <br/> And I run all the way home <br/> Checking over my shoulder <br/> Afraid that you haven’t left me alone <br/> And sure enough, I see you again, <br/> Hovering at my train station, <br/> Day after day <br/> So I keep running <br/> I was thirteen <br/>   <br/> It’s summer <br/> I’ll be across oceans in less than a week, and this is one of my last days with two girls who have come to mean so much to me <br/> And we are walking up a hill <br/> Four lanes of traffic beside us <br/> You two come along, shouting at us from your truck <br/> “Hey, girl!” <br/> Isn’t that a brilliant thing to say? <br/> It’s so terribly thoughtful of you, you know <br/> How else would those fifteen-year-old girls be able to live with themselves? <br/> Fortunately, they have you to yell at them <br/> Aren’t you a national treasure! <br/> We really did need you to interrupt one of our last chances to say goodbye   <br/> I really can’t thank you enough <br/> I was thirteen <br/>   <br/>
