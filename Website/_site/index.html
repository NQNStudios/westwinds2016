	 	        <p>West Winds is West High School's literary and art magazine since the 1914/15 school year. Our goal is to give a voice to all of the young artists at West High and encourage them to continue sharing their work with the world. We also aim to introduce students to the world of publishing and help them explore possible career paths. We publish a full color magazine at the end of the school year; each issue has its own personality, just like each graduating class.</p>

<p>In 2013 we introduced a website counterpart to the physical magazine, in order to showcase more student work and art in mediums such as music and prose. Like the magazine, the entire website is created by the effort of students on the West Winds staff.</p>

<p>To submit your work to West Winds, email your files to <strong>westwindssubmissions@gmail.com</strong> or deliver your writing to our club supervisor, Mr. Packer. Your submission will have priority if you send it earlier in the school year.</p>

<p>Anyone interested in publishing or the arts is welcome to join West Winds. No prior experience is needed, but we are looking for students with experience with any of the following: Photoshop, Indesign, photography, graphic design, film, recording music, coding, or editing written pieces.</p>

<p>Feel free to drop by our weekly meetings or contact Mr. Packer or the current Editor-in-Chief for more information about the club.</p>
